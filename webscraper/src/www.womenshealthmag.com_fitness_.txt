Workout Routine Finder: Search Hundreds Of Routines to Find Your Perfect Workout

Feeling inspired to work out but not sure what to do? Well, consider your problem solved: The
Women's Health
Workout Finder Tool is here to help you find a routine that fits your goals, equipment preferences, and timeframe in seconds.
How it works: In the interactive window below, select your responses to the following three questions.
What type of workout do you want to do today?
How much time do you have?
Do you want to use equipment?
Next, you'll be prompted with personalized options from the
WH
workout database that check *all* the boxes you were looking for. Hit "Get Started" beneath your winning choice, and the workout will open in a new browser window.
Then, you're ready to sweat. It's that easy!
Should you prioritize cardio or strength training workouts?
The
WH
workout database features hundreds of workouts that are either strength-focused, cardio-focused, or a blend of both. The type you choose ultimately depends on your personal goals.
For example, if you are looking to build muscle and improve overall strength,
trainers generally recommend
prioritizing resistance training (and doing it
before
you get your cardio in so you have the energy to lift heavy). On the other hand, if you're working on endurance or training for, say, a 5K, lean into cardio workouts first and foremost—then supplement them with strength training. (This
complete guide to cardio versus resistance training
goes even deeper.)

How should you warm up and cool down?
Most of the workouts provided include a brief warm-up and post-workout stretch. You're always encouraged to tack on additional warm-up and cooldown time to ensure you're priming your joints and muscles properly beforehand and stretching out and relaxing your body after.
Here's a list of bonus warm-ups and cooldowns to choose from:

How We Chose This Year’s Winners
You’re a self-described
Pilates girlie
. A
hot-girl walker
. A mom who owns the weight room. Maybe you’re all of the above, depending on the day. These fitness identities have become more than just trends—they’re communities. From
walking clubs
and
barre classes
to
pickleball leagues
, our favorite workouts help us connect with like-minded people and keep us coming back again and again.
And, let’s be honest, they guide our shopping choices.
For the 2025
Women’s Health
Fitness Awards, we’ve organized the winner categories around the most popular workout types. The goal? To make it as simple as possible for you to find the products that match your fitness personality (because, let’s face it, the dumbbells that turn up the burn in your coworker’s virtual barre class might not be the ones you need to become the deadlift queen you dream of).
What’s inside this comprehensive guide: the top fitness products that surprised and delighted us this year—and helped us elevate our training in ways we never imagined. The yoga mats that stayed slip-free through a sweaty flow. The adjustable dumbbells that made
at-home strength training workouts
more accessible. The hiking shoes that kept us blister-free in inclement weather.
From reliable staples to cutting-edge tech, this is the gear you’ll want to get your hands on—and share with your own workout community. New gains and goals, unlocked.

The best gear and equipment—big and small—to build muscle
Best Smart Home Gym
Tonal 2
Shop at tonal.com
This is *the* smart home gym setup worth investing in due to several features that other smart gyms don’t have. For instance, the technology starts you at the perfect weight for every move and automatically adjusts as you get stronger, while features like Spotter Mode let you push limits safely, making every workout ultra-efficient for strength gains.
Best Adjustable Dumbbells
Flybird Fitness Quick Adjustable Dumbbell Weight Set (25 Lbs.)
$229 at flybirdfitness.com
Most adjustable dumbbells are hundreds of dollars and still pretty bulky—but not this find. "They’re fit for a small home and go up to 25 pounds—perfect for anyone new to weight training or in need of space-saving equipment at a reasonable price," says Lindsay Gellar,
WH
lifestyle director.
Best Legging With Pockets
Rhone Revive Pocket Legging
$108 at Amazon
“When I
competed in a Hyrox race
last summer, the secure, no-bounce side pockets in these leggings kept my phone in place so I could stay in touch with my relay team without worrying about it getting in the way,” says
WH
fitness editor Talene Appleton. “They’re comfortable, functional, with a waistband that really snatches without feeling restrictive, which, as someone who has tested a lot of leggings, is clearly a really hard balance to strike.”
Best Barefoot Training Shoe
Vivobarefoot Motus Strength Barefoot Zero-Drop Shoes
$135 at Amazon
$200 at Vivobarefoot
Many so-called
barefoot training
shoes still feel like you’re wearing, well, heavy-duty footwear. This pick from Vivobarefoot has a legit barely-there feel so you can root your soles into the floor while you lift—without actually having to go sans sneaks at the gym.
Best Multipurpose Weight
Obshay Swirl White Marble Dumbbell
$96 at obshay.com
You’ve never seen a free weight as aesthetically beautiful as this one, right? Whether you use it for upper-body exercises or admire it perched on your bookshelf, the sculptural design is both functional and stylish—and you won’t have to sacrifice storage space since you won’t want to put it away post-workout.
Best Protein Hack
Hoshi Health Protein Powder Funnel Set
$17 at Amazon
“After a workout, I want to be able to get in a fast-digesting protein source ASAP,” says
Gabrielle Savary
, trainer and group fitness instructor at the Strength Club in New York. This handy funnel has caps for each end to hold pre-portioned protein and “makes it super easy to put your protein—or BCAAs, pre-workout, anything—into the opening of a water or shaker bottle—no mess.” And no toting around a Ziploc of powder or an entire canister in your gym bag. Whew.
Best Barbell Training App
Metric VBT App
Shop at metric.coach
This one-of-a-kind barbell-focused fitness app gives you “tangible feedback about your rate of perceived exertion, or RPE, which is your effort level,” says trainer and kettlebell specialist
Taylor Beebe
. “I also love that it shows the bar path so I can address technique issues.” After recording iPhone or iPad videos of yourself during a
barbell training
exercise, you can input them into this app to track bar speed, path, rep tempo, and more.
Best Creatine Supplement
Optimum Nutrition Micronized Creatine Capsules
Creatine
is one of the safest supplements any strength training athlete can take to increase performance and recovery, Beebe says. “What I hated about powder versions was that you needed either water and/or a blender bottle to consume it,” she says. “The capsules make it easy to take on the go.”
Best Weightlifting Gloves
Versa Gripps
$6 at versagripps.com
Tyneka Pack
, founder and CEO of Impackt Fitness, says these were the first grip protectors that actually fit her hands (and didn’t feel designed for men). What’s more, other gloves have torn quickly for Pack—but she’s used the same pair of Versas since 2018 (talk about durability!). “They allow me to focus on lifting without my forearms giving out first,” Pack says. “For women who are looking to elevate their weight training, these are a must.”
Best Strength Training Kit
Centr Strength Training Kit
$98 at Walmart
A pullup bar, a sandbag, pushup handles, and bodyweight straps? When it comes to fitness kits, you won’t find as worthy an assortment of workout goodies at such an affordable price. “If you’re just starting to build your home gym setup and have no clue what to buy, this kit is a solid starting point, with enough big and small equipment to get a great workout,” says Jacqueline Andriakos,
WH
executive health and fitness director.
Best Plant Protein Powder
Momentous 100% Plant Protein
$50 at Amazon
Finally, a plant-based powder with no weird aftertaste or artificial sweeteners that also packs 20 grams of protein from peas and rice—a slam dunk for those with dietary sensitivities. “As someone who struggles to digest whey-based powders, this has become my go-to for its simple ingredients and tasty flavor,” Appleton, who makes a “hot cocoa” by mixing it with warm almond milk.
Best Cardio Equipment
Rogue Fitness Echo Bike V3.0
Now 6% Off
$895
$845 at Rogue Fitness
“There are many other modalities that can be used to improve cardiovascular health; however, the Echo Bike is an all-around great option due to its low impact on joints, ability to generate a high level of cardio output, and usage in the gym or at home,” says Almoni Ellis, creator of
Mo Fit
, who uses it in her own training and with clients to improve conditioning.
Best Cross-Training Shoe
lululemon Chargefeel 2 Mid Workout Shoes
$148 at Lululemon
It’s not often you find a training shoe over $100 that you’re willing to buy multiple pairs of. “The versatile design provides exceptional support and stability, especially during lateral movements, and the mid-cut offers extra ankle support,” says fitness coach
Priscilla Perez
, creator of the movement and apparel community Off Duty Rituals. “My go-to shoe for everything from high-intensity training to dance—ya girl owns three different colors.”

Best Running Belt
SPIBelt
$25 at Amazon
$30
$27 at Walmart
$27 at Dick's Sporting Goods
The fan-favorite belt (multiple
WH
staffers have worn one for marathon training and race days) is deceivingly spacious, despite its compact look. It fits keys, phone, and wallet no problem and, unlike most running belts, actually stays in place on your hips when you’re in motion.
Best Weighted Vest
Empower Weighted Vest
$100 at Amazon
Not all weighted vests are designed to fit and flatter a woman’s frame, which is why trainer Ebonny Fowler loves this female-designed version to support her newfound
rucking routine
. “I love the unique X shape engineered to fit women’s curves, plus it has adjustable straps and padded shoulders for added comfort, and various weighted options to level up your workout.”
Best Over-The-Ear Headphones
Shokz OpenRun Pro 2
$180 at Amazon
$180 at Best Buy
“As a woman, I’m always on high alert during my runs—these are the only headphones I’ve found that allow me to listen to my music clearly in addition to everything around me, and also don’t fall off,” says
WH
assistant beauty editor Sabrina Talbert.
Best Jogging Stroller
Thule Urban Glide 3
$650 at Amazon
$650 at Nordstrom
$650 at Bloomingdale's
“I tested a dozen strollers from various brands firsthand before landing on the Urban Glide as a jogging stroller,” says Andriakos. “It’s simply superior when it comes to how smooth it moves and how easy it is to maneuver at any speed, over any terrain.”
Best Running Fuel
GU Energy Original Energy Gel
$16 at Amazon
$36
$27 at Walmart
WH
associate health and fitness editor Addison Aloian fuels with Gu for all races after being grossed out by numerous other gels and gummies. “It actually tastes good, is easy to swallow, and contains 20 milligrams of caffeine for an extra boost,” she says. “I literally feel as if I have more energy and I become faster once these gels hit my system.”
Best Workout Sock
Tracksmith Speed Crew Sock
$25 at Tracksmith
“I’m not sure how these can be so thin and breathable yet still have so much compression,” says Andriakos. “My feet are never swollen after a long walk, and I can feel the ground and spread my toes when lifting weights too.”
Best Workout Headband
Gymwrap 2.0
$30 at Amazon
Tammeca Rochester
, owner and founder of Harlem Cycle, describes this headband as so much better than competitors due to the way it “absorbs and wicks the sweat away,” she says. “When I take it off, my hair is completely dry. It’s great for a good cardio workout and comes in a lot of colors and styles, so I can match it to my workout gear.”
Best Running Shoe Overall
Saucony Endorphin Pro 4
$225 at Amazon
WH
testers have confirmed there’s a reason these sneakers have thousands of five-star reviews on multiple sites. As Tina Martinez, a food producer at
WH
, puts it plainly: “I swear these make me run faster—I feel like I am bouncing rather than running flat and stagnant.”
Best Running Shoe For Overpronation
Brooks Adrenaline GTS 24
$140 at Amazon
$140 at brooksrunning.com
$140 at Dick's Sporting Goods
As a runner with
overpronation
and flat feet,
Patricia Greaves
, a menopause fitness specialist, says the Brooks Adrenaline is the only shoe that provides the proper stability and support: “I’ve tried so many other brands, but Brooks are still the most comfortable for distance.”
Best Walking Shoe Overall
Hoka Mach 6
$140 at hoka.com
$210 at Amazon
$140 at Free People
“I’ve been diagnosed with
plantar fasciitis
, bone spurs, foot arthritis, and flat feet,” says Fowler, who is a full-time fitness instructor, mom to a very active 6-year-old boy, and an avid walker. “I used to purchase cushioned shoe insoles for my sneakers—this is the only pair that’s allowed me to ditch the insoles.”
Best Splurgeworthy Walking Shoe
Athletic Propulsion Labs Women's Jogger
$400 at Athletic Propulsion Labs
“This is the only sneaker at this price point that I have ever deemed worth it to purchase in another color,” Andriakos says. “They are comfortable all day, and I have yet to be out and not receive a compliment on the retro, bright style and silhouette."
What's more: Ashley Nicole, a trainer and the founder of
RA Warrior Fitness
, requires walking shoes that are comfortable enough when her rheumatoid arthritis symptoms are flaring up, "and these sneakers genuinely make me want to move more," she says.
Best Recovery Shoe
Oofos OOahh Slide
$60 at Amazon
$119 at Walmart
$60 at Nordstrom
There are countless recovery slides on the market—but these boast the approval of foot doctors and come in an unmatched assortment of pretty colors. “My podiatrist told me I had to get a pair for work-from-home days and going to and from barefoot workout classes,” Andriakos says. “I notice my chronic foot pain is lightyears better when I’ve been wearing these more regularly.”
Best High-Impact Sports Bra
Spanx High Impact Sports Bra
$78 at Spanx
After enough workouts and dryer cycles, even the toughest sports bras usually need to be retired—but not this one. Somehow it still packs compression and structure after hundreds of wears and keeps even the biggest busts in place during bouncy runs.
Beach Riot catsuit, Madewell earrings
The Sculpt Queen
Everything you need to turn up the burn in Pilates, yoga, barre, and sculpt-style workouts
Best Lightweight Dumbbells
Stakt Weights
$98 at Nordstrom
$98 at shopstakt.com
We have yet to find a better pair of lightweight adjustable weights on the market. (These can be turned into two-, four-, or six-pound loads.) “They’re the perfect light weight to level up
Pilates
or
barre workouts
at home—and they received
oohs
and
aahs
from everyone at our team photo shoot!” Andriakos says.
Best Grip Socks
Pointe Studio Crew Sock
$48 at pointestudio.com
Let’s be real: No one wants to be forced into purchasing the overpriced branded grip socks at your local barre spot. Pointe Studio solves that problem with its unmatched range of prints, patterns, and colorways…at less than $20 a pair. “There’s a sock to match every outfit or mood, and you won’t slip on the reformer,” says
WH
contributing editor Amy Wilkinson, who is also a Pilates instructor at
Aline Pilates
in New York City.
Best Warm-Up Layer
Daughter Lessons Utility Vest
$148 at daughterlessonsnyc.com
This stylish vest will collect compliments everywhere you go and is the most versatile warm-up layer out there. “You can zip the sleeves off during a walk or workout for more breathability, or just for a different fashion look at the office,” Andriakos says.
Best Low-Impact Sports Bra
Alo Yoga Airlift Intrigue Bra
$68 at Alo Yoga
Aloian swears by this flattering, adjustable sports bra for smaller chests for just about any type of workout. “It’s insanely comfortable and the sides never dig into my armpits.”
Best Sleeveless Workout Onesie
Beach Riot Jewel Catsuit
$148 at beachriot.com
Nicole purchased this bodysuit after rocking it for a photo shoot for
WH
’s
Strong and Fit Over 40
(coming this spring)
. “I fell in love with how it accentuates my figure, boosts confidence, and is versatile enough to seamlessly transition from the gym to a stylish outing.”
Best Exercise Mat
Stakt Mat Pro
$118 at Nordstrom
$118
$69 at shopstakt.com
The new Mat Pro from Stakt has superior grip compared to the original, “so you’re able to jump and hold a plank better,” says corrective exercise specialist Tatiana Lampa, creator of
Training With T
. The foldable mat also allows you to do a variety of movements, such as
triceps dips
(on the edge when stacked), elevated reverse lunges, and more.
Best Resistance Band
Power Systems Flat Band
$6 at power-systems.com
This band is a staple in Fowler’s Pilates, barre, and stretch classes. When it comes to gripping the thin piece of rubber, “the flatness of it provides more comfort than traditional thick resistance bands,” she says—which often dig into your palms uncomfortably or are too narrow to get a solid grasp on.
Best Longsleeve Workout Onesie
J Sculpt Everyday Playsuit Backless Long Sleeve Bodysuit
$78 at jsculptfitness.com
“The bodysuit sculpts my body, lifting and shaping in all the right places,” says Tonyael Miller, certified trainer and the creator of Tonyael Miller Fitness. “I feel incredibly sexy and confident every time I put it on—it boosts my performance and makes me feel powerful.”
Justin Steele

The Sporty Adventurer
Gear that guarantees comfort and convenience of just about any outdoor extracurricular
Best Cold-Weather Gloves
Skida Pursuit Liner Glove
$40 at skida.com
Most liner gloves come in boring black and are only shoddy at best when they claim to be touchscreen friendly. These Skida liners come in fun prints and actually allow you to use your gadgets while skiing, running, cycling, or walking your dog.
Best Sport Sunglasses
KOO Nova
$200 at Amazon
“I’ve never found a pair with such a high-quality continuous lens that offers seamless vision even in my periphery,” says Appleton. “I exclusively reach for these sunnies for anything outdoors.”
Best Cycling Shoe
Tiem Slipstream Cycling Shoe
$135 at Amazon
“Tiem are, by far, the most comfortable cycling shoes I’ve ever used,” says Rochester. “When you are off the bike, you can walk normally, without fear of falling, and they are not as hard as other cycling shoes that have caused my feet to cramp.”
Best Tennis Bag
Caraa Tennis Quilted Backpack
$290 at caraa.co

Live out your
Challengers
dreams with this one-of-a-kind carrier that can be worn as a tote or a backpack, fits two racquets and the rest of your necessities, and is still stylish enough to take you from the court to lunch after.
Best Fanny Pack
Cotopaxi Kapai 1.5 L Del Dia Hip Pack
$35 at REI
Each Cotopaxi Del Día is made from colorful, 100 percent recycled deadstock materials, giving each one its own unique colorway (read: no one else will have your exact bag!). The durable bags have two compartments and are the perfect size to carry essentials on a walk, hike, or run.
Best Trail Shoe
Salomon XT-6 Gore-Tex®
$220 at Nordstrom
$220 at Revolve
$220 at Ssense
Get your hands on these
celeb-favorite, fashion-editor-approved sneakers
fast (they tend to sell out!): They’re durable, waterproof, and stable for the harshest trail and hiking conditions but look downright designer, unlike most bulky boots.
Best Gym Bag
BEIS The Sport Backpack
$98 at Revolve
The pack beats out other gym bags because of its genius real-world design elements: a ventilated shoe compartment, a water bottle holder that actually fits a large bottle, space for clothes and a full-size laptop—and it still appears relatively small. “It has surprisingly great space on the inside without being bulky,” says Savary.
Alo Yoga jacket and shorts, FP Movement top, Gorjana necklace, Bombas socks, Pony sneakers
The Smart Sweater
Cutting-edge gadgets that give you real-time workout data and elevate performance
Best New All-Purpose Watch
Polar Vantage M3
$390 at Amazon
$400 at Walmart
Polar has a long-standing reputation for making one of the best wearables on the market for heart rate accuracy, which is key if you keep tabs on your HR zone during training. The Training Load feature on the Vantage M3 tracks both cardio load (a measure of cardiovascular stress) and muscular load (to monitor the impact on your muscles). Prepping for race day? Also exclusive to Polar technology is the unique Running Index, which estimates your VO2 max and can predict your race performance over different distances.
Best Multipurpose Recovery Tool
Mobot 2-in-1 Foam Roller Water Bottle
$45 at Amazon
This two-in-one water bottle doubles as a foam roller and is the perfect travel companion for any fitness buff. “I love it for rolling out my neck and back during long flights (though TSA always does a double take!),” says Appleton.
Best Wellness Tracker
Oura Ring 4
$499 at Amazon
$499 at Target
$499 at Best Buy
The newest version is thinner than ever and lays flush against the finger (unlike previous models that had external sensors on the inside of the band). As a mom of two young kids, Perez likes that the Oura Ring gives her key insights “into how much rest I really need to feel my best.” Unlike other rings that prioritize sleep, the Oura also tracks activity level, recovery and readiness, and cycle and fertility (
cycle-syncing workouts
, anyone?), “giving me a complete picture of my wellness,” she adds.
Best Muscle Growth Tech
Smart Tools SmartCuffs® 4.0 PRO
$499 at smarttoolsplus.com
Ever wish you could get the benefits of lifting heavy weights without actually having to lug around a barbell? Blood flow restriction (BFR) training works by restricting blood flow to a limb, tricking your body into thinking you’re working harder than you actually are—leading to gains in muscle, strength, and endurance with lighter resistance. “These BFR cuffs are perfect for upping the intensity of my home workouts without heavy weights,” says Appleton.
Best Recovery Tracker
WHOOP 4.0
$239 at Amazon
$239 at Dick's Sporting Goods
$239 at Best Buy
Miller considers the Whoop a “must-buy for anyone looking to truly understand their body and improve their health.” Her favorite aspects? “The continuous monitoring and deep insights it gives into my body’s performance and recovery, especially the sleep and recovery scores,” she says—as well as the fact that it sits on the wrist and doesn’t get in the way when lifting weights.
Best Red Light Therapy Tool
Kineon Move+ Pro LED & Laser
Now 29% Off
$699
$499 at kineon.io
Red light therapy
stimulates blood flow and energy production in cells, helping to reduce pain and inflammation and promote tissue repair. This brace is one of the few portable designs out there, perfect for targeting smaller areas. “I’ve been using it to tackle post-workout knee soreness and can visibly see a reduction in swelling after just a 20-minute session every time,” says Appleton.
Best Percussion Massager
Hyperice Hypervolt Go 2
$129 at Women's Health Shop
The Go 2 is light and portable and fits in your gym bag, says Lampa. This model also reigns supreme because it’s TSA-approved, “so you can fly with it and never have to worry about being too sore after a workout.” You can also pair it with the heated attachment for a warm massage.
Best Wireless Earbuds
Apple AirPods Pro 2
Now 20% Off
$249
$199 at Amazon
$199 at Walmart
$250 at Target
The AirPods Pro 2 pack impressive functionality (fine-tuned noise cancellation, a six-hour charge life…). But what really sets them apart is how they double as hearing aids and allow you to complete a five-minute DIY hearing test to determine if you have even mild hearing loss.
Best Water Bottle
Bala Bottle
$59 at shopbala.com
This insulated bottle has a feature that we’ve never seen on any other water bottle: The ring on the cap is magnetic and acts as a phone stand for filming fitness content or videos that you can play back for a form check.
Best Headphones
Beats Solo 4
$199 at Amazon
$199 at Walmart
$157 at Macy's
“As a music lover and competitive powerlifter, the Beats Solo 4 boosts my workout energy and has the best sound quality and ease of use compared to other headphones,” says Ellis. “I struggle with earbuds falling out during my workout, so it’s a great alternative to ensure the energy never pauses during training.”
Best Plyometric Training Tool
Plyomat Switch Mat (Portable)
$250 at plyomat.com
“As a fitness coach, I like to have tangible data for both myself and my athletes,” says Beebe. The only-of-its-kind Plyomat shows ground contact time and force output for anyone looking to understand and boost their performance with new data points. “When you create competition or gamify training, you are able to push harder,” she adds.
Best Foam Roller
Theragun Wave Duo
$99 at Therabody
$99 at Amazon
$99
$79 at Walmart
The unique shape of this vibrating massage tool is ergonomically designed to fit into the curves of your neck, back, and spine. “I can maneuver it to reach those tough-to-hit spots, and it is super travel-friendly,” Andriakos says.
Best VR Fitness Platform
Alo Moves XR on Meta Quest
$69 at alomoves.com
Put on your leggings and
Meta Quest headset
and transport yourself in seconds to Greece or Switzerland for a workout with top Alo Moves trainers like yogi Ashley Galvin and Pilates pro Bianca Wise. Some VR experiences leave you dizzy or overstimulated; Alo Moves’ 3D world is so high quality you’ll forget you’re in your living room.

This 20-Minute Dumbbell Conditioning Routine Works Your Lower Body, Core, And Endurance
This 20-Minute Dumbbell Conditioning Routine Works Your Lower Body, Core, And Endurance
All you need is a pair of dumbbells.

“Let’s go, athletes!” That’s the type of high-energy and empowering encouragement you can expect to hear from trainer Danyele Wilson for the next 20 minutes in this
conditioning
and strength workout as part of the
Women’s Health
Flex Challenge
—a 28-day, customizable full-body workout program.
Try Wilson's Dumbbell Conditioning Workout
There are a whole lot of mind and body benefits to this sweat sesh. “We're not training to get smaller or take up less space because training should never be about what we're trying to lose,” Wilson says. “It's actually about everything you stand to gain.” What you have to gain from the workout video below? Strength, power,
and
confidence, she says.
Whether your goal is to
increase lean muscle mass
,
strengthen your core
, or
boost endurance
, conditioning plays an important role in any workout regimen. And, all you need is a set of
dumbbells
to get started.
Meet your trainer:
Danyele Wilson, CPT, is a trainer, fitness content creator, founder of
SPARC
, a fitness and mindset app for women, and a
WH
January 2025 cover star. Her training focuses on heavy weights and conditioning to build strength, power, confidence, and longevity.
Your trainer will guide you through a seven-exercise warm-up featuring moves like the
world’s greatest stretch
, hamstring scoops, and fast-feet runs before you embark on two
supersets
(when you do two different exercises back-to-back with little or no rest in between), with three rounds each.
Try Wilson's Dumbbell Conditioning Workout
“The workout I programmed is going to help you increase your
lower-body
power,” says Wilson. “It's going to help you increase your
core
stability. It's going to help you be more explosive, more powerful, and it's going to help you with your
cardiovascular endurance
.”
First, you’ll work your
quads
,
glutes
,
hamstrings
, and
calves
—and get your heart rate up—with sumo squats and drop squats. Then, you’ll switch up to chest presses from a glute bridge and alternating single-arm dumbbell snatches to really focus on your power.
Ending on a finisher of fast feet to drop, Wilson wraps up with a yoga-class worthy cooldown.
You'll keep coming back to this workout during the
WH
Flex Challenge. Once you've completed your 28-day challenge track, there are two alternative tracks to try out for even more gains. Or, return to this video in your own workout routine and watch yourself get stronger.

This Dumbbell Strength Workout Is Only 10 Minutes And Strengthens Every Muscle Group
A head-to-toe burn in no time? Yes, please.

There's no time quite as motivating as the New Year to refresh your fitness routine. And trainer Ajahzi Gardner’s full-body strength workout—part of the
Women's Health
Flex Challenge
—will help you do just that.
The 10-minute circuit delivers a serious burn in minimal time, making it the perfect pick-me-up for anyone looking to move their bod and hone their strength without spending hours in the gym.
Try Gardner's Full-Body Strength Workout
Gardner is passionate about making strength training accessible. She believes fitness should be a sustainable part of your life, not something that feels overwhelming or unattainable—and that mindset approach shines through in this routine. “I wanted this to be a workout anyone could do, anywhere,” says Gardner.
Using light and moderate dumbbells, this routine features exercises like thrusters, gorilla rows, and reverse lunges, targeting every major muscle group. “The goal was to create something efficient and scalable, so you can build strength and keep your heart rate up, no matter your fitness level,” she says.
Meet your trainer:
Ajahzi Gardner
, CPT, is a
WH
January 2025 cover star, content creator, and fitness coach based in Las Vegas. She is the founder and head trainer of
Project Soul
, an online coaching platform that focuses on simple, equipment-light workouts.
Designed with moderate reps and sets, this workout is a great starting point for beginners; think of it more like an exercise snack than a full-blown strength training sesh. And if you’re a more advanced exerciser looking for the complete exercise meal, try cycling through the circuit three or four times for an added push.
Try Gardner's Full-Body Strength Workout
But this session isn’t just about powering through the main circuit—it’s designed with thoughtful warm-up and cooldown components to set you up for success. The warm-up primes your body with moves like monster walks and resistance band pull-aparts, preparing your muscles and joints for the actual exercises you’ll be doing in the main circuit. On the flip side, the cooldown helps keep you ready for whatever
WH
Flex Challenge workout you’ll be tackling next.
Whether you’re fitting it into a busy schedule or building a consistent routine, this workout is a great starting point to work out smarter, not harder. Grab your dumbbells, hit play, and let Gardner guide you through a workout that strengthens your body and energizes your day.

If you’re looking for a workout that gets your heart rate climbing and body sweating in no time, Hannah Bower’s 20-minute bodyweight HIIT session is
it
. As part of the
Women's Health
Flex Challenge
, this high-energy routine combines strength, endurance, and cardio into one efficient workout—no equipment needed.
Try Bower's 20-Minute Bodyweight HIIT Workout
As a certified pre- and post-natal fitness expert and a mom of two, Bower understands the importance of workouts that fit into busy lives. “I wanted to create something that meets people where they are,” she says. “It’s a workout you can keep coming back to as you build strength and endurance.”
Meet your trainer:
Hannah Bower
, CPT, is a fitness coach, content creator, mom of two, and pre- and postnatal exercise expert. She creates safe, inclusive
workout programs
for everyone—including beginners and expectant or postpartum moms (and even filmed this HIIT workout 18-weeks pregnant!).
This routine is structured as a 16-minute
EMOM
(a.k.a. every minute on the minute) workout, featuring high-energy multi-joint exercises like squat jumps, pushup rows, and mountain climbers. While it might seem intense at first (HIIT literally means “
high-intensity interval training
”), the beauty of this format is its adaptability—you can adjust the reps or pace based on your fitness and energy level. “Start with modified versions of the moves—like doing pushup variations from your knees—and gradually progress to harder variations,” says Bower. “The goal is to challenge yourself while building confidence in your abilities.”
The workout begins with a dynamic warm-up to get your heart pumping and loosen up stiff muscles, getting you ready for the main event. From there, you’ll dive into the first circuit. This combo of strength and cardio not only torches calories, but also improves endurance and delivers a serious muscle burn.
Try Bower's 20-Minute Bodyweight HIIT Workout
Fitness should feel rewarding, not intimidating, says Bower. “You don’t have to love it right away,” she says. “But when you start to see and feel the benefits, that’s when it becomes something you enjoy.”
This quick, yet impactful, workout might feel tough at first, but the endorphin boost it elicits will keep you coming back for more and leave you ready to take on the rest of your day (and the Flex Challenge!).

This 7-Minute Weighted Abs Workout Can Be Done Daily For A Stronger Core
This 7-Minute Weighted Abs Workout Can Be Done Daily For A Stronger Core
It's efficient and effective.

Introducing your new go-to abs routine. This seven-minute workout can be done every day to strengthen one of the most important muscle groups in your body: the core.
As part of the
Women’s Health
Flex Challenge
, trainer Jenna de León takes you through this snappy circuit that includes four core-focused moves and has you working for 40 seconds on, then 20 seconds off. All you need is a single dumbbell, and you’re less than 10 minutes from completing an intense and efficient abs workout.
Try de León's Weighted Abs Workout
“The beautiful thing about doing core exercises is that you can do it every day if you want,” says de León—and if you’re on the abs-focused track as part of the Flex Challenge, you will. Even after you wrap the challenge, this routine pairs nicely with anything else you have on deck for the day including before or after a strength-training session or Pilates, she adds.
Meet your trainer:
Jenna De León, CPT, is a
WH
January 2025 cover star, a three-time world champion bodybuilder, and fitness coach based in Houston. She is the founder and head trainer of the
Reset App
, a workout and nutrition app designed to be an inclusive platform for women of color.
A stronger core is key to just about everything, from
lifting
with proper form, to
running
better, to getting out of bed in the morning. “All workouts use core,” says de León. “Whether you're doing a squat, pullup, or pushup, it takes core work.”
Try de León's Weighted Abs Workout
Starting with a quick warm-up, de León leads you through two rounds of jumping jacks and high knees before you begin your abs circuit. Then, you’ll go through one round of sit-ups with rotation using a dumbbell, Russian twists (dumbbell optional), leg raises, and bicycle crunches—and just like that, you’re done with the tough stuff! To wrap up, you’ll enjoy 60 seconds of child’s pose and cat-cow.
Just remember: “Your core is the base of your body,” says de León. Make sure you give it enough love.
Whether you’re looking to chisel your core, build strength, or boost your aerobic capacity, the
WH
Flex Challenge (and its five all-star trainers) is all about helping you reach your personal goals. And, reminder: Once you finish one Flex Challenge track, there are two other tracks to try—or you can continue the workouts on your own time as individual sweat sessions. Let's get after it!

What Is Body Composition? What It Can Tell You—And How To Measure It
What Is Body Composition? What It Can Tell You—And How To Measure It
It’s more important than BMI.

Thanks to the ever-improving world of
fitness trackers
and
apps
, you've never had more access to personal health data. But which of the dizzying number of markers and metrics should you really be using to assess your health? One way to cut through the clutter is to focus on body composition.
if you’ve only ever heard this term used by gym bros chugging
protein shakes
, I promise it’s about more than
getting ripped.
When accurately measured and assessed by a qualified healthcare professional, your body composition can provide valuable health insights beyond your physique. Tracked over time, this metric can help you understand your progress in ways that the number on the scale certainly can’t.
That said,
how
you measure body composition matters, and no one universal body composition is ideal for everyone. It’s best to check in with doctors and other healthcare experts—like the ones you’ll hear from below—to determine your current body composition and how to use it to reach your goals.
Meet the experts:
Brittany Busse, MD, is the chief medical officer and co-founder of
ViTel Health
. Steven Shamah, MD, is the director of endoscopy at
Lenox Hill Hospital
in New York. Mathew Forzaglia, NFPT-CPT, CFSC, is a personal trainer and the founder of
Forzag Fitness
. Dana Ellis Hunnes, PhD, MPH, RD, is an assistant professor with the
Fielding School of Public Health at UCLA
and a senior dietician at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center.
Body composition is a breakdown of these three elements.
Body composition
refers to the percentages body fat, bone, and lean tissue mass (basically, the muscle, organs, water, and other types of tissue) in your body.
For example, a person may weigh 170 pounds and have a body composition of 20 percent body fat, 12 percent bone, and 68 percent lean tissue mass. This means their body is made up of 34 pounds of fat, 20 pounds of bone, and 115 pounds of muscle, organs, water, and other tissues.
For
bodybuilders
and fitness enthusiasts, changing their body composition often reflects their hard work and discipline—but knowing your body composition is useful for more than just bragging rights.
Here’s what you can learn from your body composition numbers.
Your risk for disease
Your body composition not only tells you how much body fat you have, it tells you where it’s located, which can be valuable data. For example, visceral adipose tissue (or, the fat around your abdomen) is directly related to diseases like diabetes,
cancer
,
high blood pressure
,
heart disease
, and stroke, whereas subcutaneous adipose tissue (the fat that sits right below the skin) is mainly a fuel storage depot, says Brittany Busse, MD, a longevity medicine and health optimization physician.

Keep in mind that some body fat—both visceral and subcutaneous—is normal and healthy. Your body needs fat for essential functions like hormone production and temperature regulation, to name a few. Losing too much fat could send your body into a “protective starvation mode,” which would actually start to
break down muscle
, says Dr. Busse.
And, depending on the kind of body comp screening you do, you can also get more information about your
bone density
, which is a health marker for osteopenia and osteoporosis, both of which
women in particular are at risk of
as they age.
Your
actual
fat-loss progress
You’ve heard it before: The scale doesn’t tell the whole story. And, it’s entirely possible to lose fat and never see a change in your body weight.
“I make sure that people with weight loss goals understand that the number on the scale is just the number on the scale,” says Steven Shamah, MD, the director of endoscopy at Lenox Hill Hospital. This is where body composition comes in handy, he adds. Muscle weighs more than fat, so if you start losing fat but gaining muscle, the number on the scale might not be shifting—but your body composition percentages could be.
Your strength and muscle gains
Relatedly, then, body composition metrics are useful for people who want to
put on muscle mass
and track their success in the gym. If you’re an athlete (yes,
recreational sports
count!), body composition can be a critical and sometimes overlooked training metric. Tracking muscle growth lets you know if your current programming is working, so you can continue to make gains.

How To Measure Your Body Composition
If you’re curious about your own body composition, there are plenty of ways to measure it. Each method offers varying levels of accuracy, ease, and accessibility. The “right” method for you depends on your resources and what you plan to do with any data you collect.
DEXA scan
A DEXA scan (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) is the “gold standard” for calculating body composition because it’s low cost, low radiation, and very accurate, Dr. Busse says.
This technology uses low-level X-rays to collect detailed results, including visceral fat levels, water content, and bone density. The test is performed in hospitals and medical centers and is sometimes offered in more commercial settings, like spas and sports performance clinics for anywhere between $100 and $250. When used to detect certain medical conditions, like osteoporosis, a DEXA scan may be covered by some insurance providers, but you otherwise probably couldn’t get one paid for just because you’re curious.
According to Dr. Busse, getting a DEXA scan outside of a medical environment is safe, but it’s a good idea to run your results by a doctor to get a more accurate interpretation.
Bioelectrical impedance analysis
Scales and handheld devices that measure body composition typically use a technology known as bioelectrical impedance analysis. When you stand on a scale or hold a pair of electrodes, the device produces an electrical current and calculates your body composition based on how quickly it travels through your body.
Tools that use bioelectrical impedance analysis are popular with coaches, trainers, and everyday athletes, as they’re affordable (popular models are available online for around $300) and easy to use.
However, what they offer in convenience, they lack in accuracy, says Mathew Forzaglia, NFPT-CPT, CFSC, founder of Forzag Fitness. “It will give you, maybe, a plus-three or minus-three reading on your actual body fat,” he says. “But then we have a number we can work off of.”
Skinfold caliper
A skinfold caliper is a handheld instrument used to pinch and measure the width of a skinfold in millimeters. Calipers are used by fitness coaches and trainers as well as medical professionals in clinical settings. A practitioner collects measurements from between four and nine areas of the body, depending on the protocol, and inputs them into a formula to calculate body fat percentage.
The results of this method are limited to subcutaneous fat (the fat located just below your skin) so you won’t get a sense of your visceral fat or a detailed breakdown of your lean mass. Plus, accuracy can vary significantly based on how experienced and skilled the administrator is.
Also, skin pinching can be physically uncomfortable and awkward for some people. “You’re put in a very vulnerable position, and then you’re getting real-time feedback on how much body fat you have,” Forzaglia says. “For someone who’s not confident in the gym or with their body, that could put a damper on them.”
MRI
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide body composition information, but it’s typically used to measure fat accumulation in specific tissues and organs, like the liver and pancreas, rather than generate whole-body calculations. Additionally, the cost of using MRI and the time required to administer the screening can be prohibitive for clinicians and patients.
You’d likely only be prescribed a full-body MRI if your doctor thought it was medically necessary, so this isn’t the most accessible option for most people.
Body composition might be more important than BMI.
Another common body measurement tool is the
body mass index (BMI)
, which makes its calculation from two factors: height and weight. It’s still widely used by the medical community to determine whether or not someone is a healthy weight despite not accounting for body fat percentage and muscle mass, but that might be changing. “I think in the next five years, we’ll see more of an emphasis on body composition and other parameters than BMI,” says Dr. Shamah.
The biggest reason why: It just doesn’t give enough information. “BMI is not an accurate measure of body composition,” says Dana Ellis Hunnes, PhD, MPH, RD, assistant professor at the Fielding School of Public Health at UCLA. “You can have a BMI of 36 and be a bodybuilder with 10 percent body fat or less or you can have a BMI of 36 and be 40 percent fat,” she says.
Also, BMI is outdated and exclusionary. When it was first developed in the 19th century, statisticians exclusively used data collected from caucasian men, excluding women and people of different races and ethnicities, Dr. Shamah says, and, “it hasn’t changed since.”

How To Change Your Body Composition
To change your body composition, you most likely need to adjust your diet and fitness routine. But depending on your goals, it may not be as straightforward as eating less and exercising more.
Losing weight requires a calorie deficit; you need to burn more than you consume. Working with a nutritionist or doctor, you can determine exactly what this means for you. “But weight loss should not be confused with fat loss,” Dr. Busse says. “Much of weight loss can also be loss of muscle mass.”
To
preserve muscle as you lose body fat,
she recommends eating one gram (or more) of high-quality
protein
, which is essential to muscle growth and repair, for every pound of body weight. And lifting is non-negotiable. “People should
weight train
at least three times a week,” Dr. Busse says. “Weight training will build muscle mass, which will inevitably lead to improved metabolic health and fat loss.”
Keep up your cardio, too. But, if you’re a
HIIT
addict, you may want to
try slowing things down
. “
Zone 2 cardio
is the most effective way to burn fat while sparing muscle. This is exercising at a level where you can hold a ‘breathy’ conversation comfortably for 45-60 minutes,” Dr. Busse says. “
Walking on an incline
,
cycling
, and
rucking
are all examples of Zone 2 workouts,” she says.
Lastly, remember that certain health and social factors beyond your control may impact your progress. Age, hormones, and genetics all play a role in body composition, as does access to high-quality food and medical care. Not everyone has the same amount of time to spend exercising. So, take it easy on yourself, and if you can, get help and support as you work toward your goals.

This Low-Impact Workout Packs A Benefit That Pilates Doesn't
Three years ago, I was diagnosed with
fibromyalgia
, a syndrome that causes chronic pain all over my body. I had to find a
low-impact workout
to replace running to keep my pain away, so I started going to Pure Barre. More than 500 classes later, it's changed my life.
When I first felt my muscles tighten after taking a few classes, I immediately became addicted to the burn. The best part was that I actually felt good after each workout. Sore, yes, but fibromyalgia-pain free. A lot of the exercises in the class reminded me of what I did at physical therapy but enhanced. It was a win-win.
It was a challenge at first, though, since I had no idea what I was doing. I didn't even feel challenged until my instructors corrected my form and I was able to really feel each move working different parts of my body.
Get a dancer's booty with these 12 barre-inspired exercises:
​
​
Soon enough, I was able to leave my comfort zone and really push myself to feel the burning of each muscle. I could trust that this pain was good pain, knowing that my form was correct and the shaking my muscles felt was a challenge, not a bad thing.
Still, there was a level of self-consciousness
starting a new workout
, and I was initially afraid people would judge me for not being in good enough shape. Pure Barre hosts challenges, though, which helped me reach for milestones that were related to me, not anyone else. The challenges involve taking from 100 classes to 1,000, offering perks like free classes and praise on social media. When I used to run, I was the only person who celebrated my success, so the recognition from the studio and shout outs from instructors during class was hugely motivating.

Plus, these little challenges made realize that everyone was at a different level, everyone was a different size, everyone had a
different goal
, and I was never going to fit in with what everyone else was doing.
After losing 40 pounds in college, I never felt comfortable with my body. At an average weight, I weighed myself multiple times a day hoping to see a smaller number. Now, that is not the case. I weigh the
same exact number
as I did when I started taking barre class, but I don't look the same. My arms are toned. My stomach is flatter. My legs are stronger. And most importantly: I am happy with the way I look.
Not everyone is going to love barre, but for me, it became the workout I'd always been looking for. It's sort of like dating. It took me a while to feel like it was
the right workout for me
, and there are still things about it that annoy me (there are just so many lunges!).
But I've learned to accept the flaws, just like it's a relationship (and it kind of is). The flaws are all part of the challenge, and I love how it makes me feel about myself more than anything.

Why Trust Us?
One thing about the editors of
Women’s Health
: We’ve tested
a lot
of workout apps. Whether you’re a total
fitness newcomer
or an experienced gym goer, your sweat sessions can be made just that much better with the help of handy platforms you can find right in your app store.
There are apps for every kind of exerciser, whether you're the generalist looking for a good
workout library
, the obsessive activity tracker, and the runner
prepping for a race
. If you’re looking to connect with a trainer, get a customized workout plan, or find some epic and efficient workouts, read on.
What To Consider
When picking a workout app, first make sure it matches your
modality
. A runner is going to want something totally different from someone primarily looking for an app that will help them strength train or a
HIIT
fanatic.
Then, consider the
equipment
you might need for each app. Are you someone who needs flexible, minimal-equipment workouts or do you have access to a gym?
You’ll also want to consider if 1:1 time with a trainer and real-time feedback is necessary—and just
how social the app is
. Some apps are community-focused and allow you to interact with other users and a coach, while others are big content hubs.
Finally, of course, you’ll want to consider
price
. Apps on this list range from free to nearly $200 a month.
How We Chose
WH
editors and our trusted
Strength In Diversity
(SID) trainers are constantly testing and trying new fitness apps throughout the year, so we polled them about their most-used and most-loved platforms. The apps on this list represent the ones that fast-tracked strength and performance gains, were user-friendly, and really delivered on the user experience and kept us returning to our workout plan. Consider these picks the ones we will never delete (even if we are running low on storage!).
1
Best Overall: Ladder
Ladder
Get The App
Price:
$14.99 or $29.99 a month, depending on your plan
Available on:
iOS
WH
editors and SID trainers alike are obsessed with Ladder, which was co-founded by a
WH
advisory board member Lauren Kanski, CPT. It gives you the best of both worlds with intense and effective guided workouts and personal training from actual coaches.
Here’s how it works: When you download the app, you’ll select a team based on your goals and preferred training style (I recently joined coach Maia’s Define team, which is
strength
and
Pilates
-based), and get five-plus brand new workouts from your coach weekly.
“Ladder offers on-demand programming for all users with demo videos and in-ear coaching,” says Taylor Beebe, CPT, a member of the SID class of 2024. “They offer over 10 different coaches and programs at varying fitness levels and unique specialties, so it's easy for anyone to find a coach that resonates with them.”
WH
executive editor Abby Cuffey and executive health and fitness director Jacqueline Andriakos have been using Ladder for years for the
kettlebell
workouts in the Body and Bell program (created by Kanski) in the app; love and life director Lindsay Geller has been using it more than ever thanks to their recently launched prenatal track.
Ladder is also provides a chat and feedback feature, integration with your music, and progress tracking.
2
Best For Multi-Sport Tracking: Strava
Courtesy of Strava
Get The App
Price:
Free, $6.67, or $11.99 a month, depending on your plan
Available on:
Android
and
iOS
Strava is definitely my most-used fitness app—and for good reason. Strava allows you to track your
runs
,
walks
,
bike rides
,
strength training sessions
, and basically any other activity you might want to do (they literally have canoe and kitesurf options, so feel free to dream big).
As someone who bounces around from workout classes to the gym to the track, I love having all of my workouts saved in one spot so I can look back at what I did for the week. And, as a
runner
, I’m obsessed with the insights I can get about my pace and progress. It’s integrated with most
smart watches
, provides info about popular routes other runners have taken, and allows you to set weekly goals for yourself, which keeps me super motivated.
One other key thing about Strava: It’s a social app. You can connect with your friends and share your accomplishments and adventures while giving kudos to others.

Most Joint-Friendly App: Evlo Fitness
Evlo Fitness
Get The App
Price:
$59.99 per month
Available on:
iOS
Evlo Fitness is a
strength training
app with classes that include elements of
Pilates
,
barre
,
yoga
, and light
cardio
created and exclusively taught by doctors of physical therapy. Evlo is about what it calls “gentle consistency,” which means you’ll be doing efficient, targeted movements to build strength while avoiding exercises that leave you overly sore or burned out. It’s all about being effective—without breaking your body down.
“They specialize in programming moves that are effective but also gentle on the back, shoulders, and other commonly tweaked areas,” says
WH
executive digital director Amanda Woerner. “I was getting major low back pain from all the deadlifts on the previous app I was using, and I appreciate that this app offers tons of modifications and really caters to the at-home exerciser who doesn’t have someone around to correct their form.”
On the app, you’ll have access to customized strength plans based on how often you want to work out per week, nutrition guidance, and “A++ quality” videos, says Woerner.
6
Best For Personal Training: Future
Future Personal Training
Get The App
Price:
$199 per month
Available on:
Android
and
iOS
If you’re looking for a
personal trainer
of your own, the Future app will pair you with one. Through a preliminary questionnaire, the platform suggests a coach based on your goals, experience level, and preferred coaching style (i.e., do you need some tough love or do you want a cheerleader?) who you can then work with 1:1.
Each week, your coach sends you a training plan with workouts that come with videos demoing each exercise. The plans are adjustable to what you need. Plus, you can message or video chat with your coach.
“This app has been helpful with pairing me with a strength coach who can meet me where I am in my recovery journey post-injury,” says Talbert. “I'm currently on a month-long trial and the features have been awesome. I love that I can record myself doing a move and ask for feedback. I can also flag a move that was maybe too challenging or uncomfortable and it'll give me alternatives and send those flagged moves to my coach so we can workshop it for the future.”

Best For Group Fitness Lovers: LES MILLS+
Les Mills+

Price:
$7.49 to $29.99 per month, depending on your plan

The LES MILLS+ app boasts a sweeping library of content ranging from 10 minutes to 55 minutes, with strength, cardio, mind and body and even audio-based running workouts. The platform has videos for all fitness levels, personalized recommendations, and progress tracking. One other cool feature: The app has cycle-syncing workouts to follow your menstrual cycle, too.
In LES MILLS+ workouts, you’ll find motivating coaches and good pump-up music, just as if you had gone to your local studio. “It brings the feeling of group fitness into the comfort of your own home if you're not able to get to the gym or if maybe you're not comfortable in the gym atmosphere,” says Beebe.

From the relentless news cycle to the everyday stress of family obligations, it’s no wonder many of us feel frustrated, angry, and
burnt out
. But exercise can play a crucial role in relieving all this pent-up anger and stress and regulating your emotions, according to experts.
“Different types of movement can support working through anger in different ways,” says Emily Anhalt, PsyD, psychologist and emotional fitness consultant. More intense physical activities—like
running
,
kickboxing
, or even high-intensity dancing—are effective for processing anger because they mimic our natural fight-or-flight instinct, which can allow a discharge of that energy in a helpful way, she says.
But your workout doesn’t have to leave you gasping to help you release rage. Lower intensity activities like
yoga
,
tai chi
, or
walking
—which combine movement with mindfulness—can help process emotions like anger more gently, she says. “So a combination of these two [movement styles] can be really helpful.”
Below, fitness and psychology experts explain why working out your rage works, and how to make the most of your anger-fueled sweat sessions.
Meet the experts:
Emily Anhalt
, PsyD, is a psychologist, emotional fitness consultant, and cofounder of
Coa
, a start-up offering emotional fitness classes and therapy.
Alexander Rothstein
, CSCS, ACSM-EP, is an exercise physiologist and instructor for the exercise science program at New York Institute of Technology.
Why Working Out Your Anger Feels So Therapeutic
“Anger and rage are actually really healthy emotions to experience, and we shouldn’t suppress them,” says Anhalt. By actually using the adrenaline and cortisol your body releases when experiencing anger, you're able to prevent that pent-up energy from making you feel irritable or just not yourself, she says.
Movement, particularly dynamic and repetitive forms of exercise, can be incredibly grounding, says Anhalt.
Physical activity also increases the production of endorphins—your brain’s feel-good chemicals—which can create a sense of calm and well-being. Other hormones, like endocannabinoids, cross the
blood-brain barrier
and provide a euphoric feeling, says Rothstein. This explains the emotional release or 'high' people often feel after a workout, he says.
Research shows that emotions like anger may even
boost
exercise performance for some people, especially runners who typically trot along at a slower pace. One 2020 study in
Frontiers in Psychology
explored how emotions like anger and fear impact
aerobic exercise
performance and found that anger helped participants run a two-mile time trial faster, proving that rage can be turned into powerful, productive energy.
High-intensity workouts like a sweaty
cycling
or
boxing
sesh are not only great for releasing pent-up emotions—they can also help us feel empowered and in-control, says Rothstein. But even going for a walk can help ease depression, anger, and hostility, according to a study published in the
Journal of Affective Disorders
that evaluated 352 young, healthy participants. The study found that walking between 10 and 60 minutes resulted in emotional benefits for most groups, especially when it came to the release of hostility.

6 Science-Backed Tips For Effectively Working Out Your Rage
If you’re ready to sweat out some frustration, here are some expert-backed strategies to make your workout as effective (and safe) as possible:
1. Intensity matters, but it’s not everything.
You might picture a rage workout as an all-out punching bag session, but it doesn’t always have to be high-intensity. “While activities like boxing, running, or
HIIT
can feel cathartic, lower-intensity options like yoga or a brisk walk can also help you process emotions," says Anhalt.
Moderate levels of intensity tend to lead to more positive emotional experiences post-workout, says Rothstein. But high-intensity bouts can also be effective, as long as you don't overexert yourself, which could leave you feeling worse after, he says.
A 2019 study in
Frontiers in Psychology
found that combining moderate aerobic exercise with mindfulness practices, like yoga, can improve emotion regulation. Over eight weeks, participants who followed this mind-body program saw improvements in mindfulness, emotion regulation, and aerobic fitness. The study also showed that aerobic fitness played a key role in these emotional benefits, with mindfulness boosting the connection between fitness and emotional regulation.
2. Get your heart rate up, but don’t overdo it.
One study published in
Cognition and Emotion
showed that just 30 minutes of jogging significantly reduced sadness and improved emotional regulation compared to stretching. Researchers divided 80 participants into two groups: one jogged for 30 minutes, while the other stretched. Before and after the activity, participants rated their emotional states and completed a questionnaire to assess their ability to regulate emotions. The results showed that the jogging group was better at managing their emotions, reporting less sadness and more control over their emotions compared to the stretching group, which suggests aerobic exercise may help manage emotional responses.
Aim for a moderate to vigorous intensity aerobic exercise, but be mindful not to push yourself to the point of exhaustion. Remember, the goal is to release energy and feel better, not to overtrain.
3. Do activities that you’re already familiar with.
“I usually consider a rage workout a little bit synonymous with chaotic … We want to have a big release of energy, but that also might mean that it's more dangerous, especially if it's exercises or movements that are new to you,” says Rothstein. It’s best to stick with activities you already know well and can perform safely to avoid frustration or injury, he says.
4. Set a time limit.
A rage workout doesn’t need to be long to be effective.
Research
shows that exercise durations of 20 to 60 minutes are beneficial for mood, with even shorter bouts having positive effects in most cases. If you’re feeling particularly amped, extending your workout to 45 minutes or an hour may help, but listen to your body and avoid overexerting yourself.
5. Curate your playlist.
Music can significantly enhance the mood-boosting effects of your workout, says Anhalt. Opt for tracks with high-energy beats or lyrics that resonate with your emotions, which can help trick your brain into perceiving less exertion and a better mood during exercise, according to a 2021 study in the
Journal of Functional Morphology and Kinesiology
that examined the psychophysiological and psychological influence of music preference on exercise responses and performance.
6. Choose your environment carefully.
Your surroundings matter. If you need to vent in private, consider working out at home or in a quiet space. If you thrive on communal energy, a group fitness class or gym session might be more motivating. Ensure the environment feels safe and conducive to letting go.
Sweating shouldn't be the only way you release anger.
While rage workouts can be an effective way to release pent-up frustration, it’s important to ensure they’re part of a balanced mental health routine. Over-reliance on exercise as a sole coping mechanism for anger may indicate deeper emotional challenges that need addressing.
"A proper cool-down phase is also essential," Rothstein says. "This could include stretching, foam rolling, or light mobility work to help your body recover and transition out of the high-intensity state."

Adding mindfulness, like the 2019
Frontiers in Psychology
study suggests, can take the benefits of aerobic exercise to the next level by helping you manage your emotions and feel better overall.
“Exercise is a wonderful tool, but it shouldn’t replace other forms of emotional processing,” adds Anhalt. “If you find yourself consistently using workouts to avoid dealing with your feelings, it may be time to incorporate other interventions like therapy, journaling, or mindfulness practices.”
Additionally, notice if you’re experiencing any physical symptoms of overtraining, such as chronic fatigue, irritability, or trouble sleeping. These may signal the need for more rest or a gentler approach to your workouts.

What’s Demi Moore’s Exercise Routine? Why She Gave Up Working Out—And Is More Confident Than Ever
What’s Demi Moore’s Exercise Routine? Why She Gave Up Working Out—And Is More Confident Than Ever

Why Trust Us?
Demi Moore
is an Oscar nominee.
On January 23, the actress, 62, nabbed her first-ever nomination for an Academy Award for her her work on horror film
The Substance
. It's an honor that Demi's proud to get—in her
Golden Globes
acceptance speech for the same role, she reflected on being called a "popcorn actress" in the early days of her career.
"At that time, I made that mean that this wasn't something that I was allowed to have, that I could do movies that were successful, that made a lot of money, but that I couldn't be acknowledged," she said. "I bought in, and I believed that, and that corroded me over time, to the point where, I thought, a few years ago, that maybe this was it, maybe I was complete."
Demi, who won the Golden Globe for
Best Performance by a Female Actor in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy, then gave viewers a passionate reminder to love themselves.
"In those moments when we don't think we're smart enough or pretty enough or skinny enough or successful enough, or basically just not enough, I had a woman say to me, just know you will never be enough, but you can know the value of your worth if you just put down a measuring stick," she shared. "And so today, I celebrate this as a marker of my wholeness and of the love that is driving me, and for the gift of doing something I love and being reminded that I do belong. Thank you so much."
It's a message that will connect with film viewers:
The Substance
follows famous aerobics instructor Elisabeth Sparkle (Demi), who's fired on her 50
th
birthday.
“I think from a human point, I relate, but I’m not Elisabeth,” Demi told the
Los Angeles Times
in September. “There are different interpretations that she could have had in responding to [being fired], although we wouldn’t have had the same movie.”
While promoting her movie, Demi has opened up about her own history with Hollywood's beauty standards, adding that, in the past, she didn’t approach fitness and wellness in the healthiest way. Here’s what she’s shared about her workout routine—and why she no longer does "hard exercise."
Demi felt ‘pressure’ to lose weight postpartum.
Demi, a mom of three, filmed her iconic 1993 movie
Indecent Proposal
after having her second daughter, Scout. But the process wasn't easy: Demi was stressed about losing weight postpartum and pushed herself too hard.
“I put so much pressure on myself,” she told
CBS Sunday Morning
on September 22
.
“I did have experiences of being told to lose weight. And all of those, while they may have been embarrassing and humiliating, it’s what I did to myself because of that.”

Scout was five or six months old when Demi was shooting
Indecent Proposal
, she said.
“So, I was feeding her through the night, getting up in the dark with a trainer, with headlamp, biking all the way to Paramount, wherever, even on location where we were shooting; then shooting a full day, which is usually a 12-hour day; and then starting all over again,” she said, noting that this would sometimes equate to 60 miles of biking a day. “Even just the idea of, like, what I did to my body, it’s, like, so crazy, so ridiculous.”
Now, Demi said she’s not thrilled she did that. “You look back and you kinda go, ‘Did it really matter that much?’ Probably not,” she said. “But at the time, I made it mean everything.”
What is Demi Moore’s exercise routine?
Demi has shared little snippets here and there of her workout routine. In 2019, she posted a video on
Instagram
doing exercises with the help of the
Mirror
(now known as Lululemon Studio).
“Five min at level one that’s doable after not working out for over four years right? I am stalling!” she wrote.

She's also been spotted attending
Pilates
classes with her daughters. In 2010, Demi shared that she does
Bikram yoga
, per
Cosmopolitan
.
View full post on Instagram
But in the 90s, Demi developed an "obsession" over her appearance for movies. It began with her 1992 film
A Few Good Men,
where she played a naval lawyer.
"I didn’t feel like I could stop exercising,” Demi wrote in her 2019 memoir
Inside Out
.
“It was my job to fit into that unforgiving military uniform I’d be wearing in two months in 'A Few Good Men.' Getting in shape for that movie launched the obsession with working out that would consume me.”

Demi was "completely in a panic," she shared in a 2020 interview with
Westman Atelier
. "[I was] dieting and exercising in a very obsessive-compulsive way... I changed my body over multiple times but wasn't really myself."
After five years, Demi decided to ease up on working out regularly.
“I added into my daily prayer a new mantra: to have the courage to be seen without padding or protection. I couldn’t go on fighting my body and my weight; I had to make peace,” she added. “I started by giving up hard exercise. I never went back into the gym in the house. Never. The room it occupied is now my office.”
She gave up the gym after filming ‘G.I. Jane.’
After shooting 1997's
G.I. Jane,
Demi broke her patterned of disordered exercise. She was “bulking up enormously” for her role as a military officer; after filming was done, she weighed more than her usual, but she decided she had enough.
“My usual reaction would have been to start starving myself again, to begin an exercise regime designed to reduce the bulk, but I did neither. I had reached my limit,” she wrote in her memoir. “When I got home to Idaho, I had an epiphany in the shower one day: I just need to be my natural size.”
In September, Demi said she "really experienced the gift of surrender."
"I was so kind of worn down in this battle that I had been in that I finally surrendered," she told
The New York Times
.
"I just started to ask to be my natural size because I didn’t know what it was. I literally couldn’t go in a gym. I couldn’t control food in that way."
Now, Demi only exercises "in my mind," she told Westman Atelier in 2020.
She lost 20 pounds during a battle with shingles.
But that isn't the only time Demi has opened up about her health. While filming
The Substance
, the actress contracted
shingles
, a “painful rash illness,” caused by the reactivation of the virus that causes chickenpox, per the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
.
“To give you an idea of the intensity, my first week that I actually had off, where it was just Margaret working, I got shingles,” she told the
Los Angeles Times
. “And I then lost, like, 20 pounds.”

Her co-star Margaret Qualley even got "crazy acne" due to the stress of filming, with Demi adding that they "put it all on the table" while making the movie.
Now, she’s more focused on self-confidence.
After decades in Hollywood, Demi now feels "emotionally sober," which impacts “the quality of how I interact with people, my ability to show up for others,” she told
The New York Times
.
“That’s all within my emotional sobriety... I can go into a room, a gathering, and if I’m uncomfortable, I don’t need to try to take the edge off it," she continued. "I can actually just go: ‘Oh, wow. Isn’t that interesting? I’m a little uncomfortable right now.’”
Now, she's focused on appreciating what's in front of her rather than chasing some ideal of perfection.
"That deep reminder of appreciating who you are, as you are, where you are, just resonated more as [filming
The Substance
]
went along," she says. "And not just the external. Really, all of those internal things of who we are that we often can overlook. And the journey of what it’s taken to get where you are."

Torn between using your ClassPass credits on your favorite upbeat
barre
class or that shake-worthy
Pilates
sesh? While the modalities have a lot in common (they both draw influence from
yoga
and
dance
and even share some of their movements, for example), depending on your goals, you might actually want to do one over the other.
Keep in mind that it’s most important to do what you like the most. Since these exercises are similar, they share a lot of benefits like increased flexibility and mobility and better posture. The best exercise is the kind that you’ll do consistently because you enjoy it. And also: There’s room for both barre and Pilates in your workout repertoire. “I wouldn’t pick one over the other,” says Kathy Bambace Salvo, director of Evolve Yoga, Pilates & Barre Programming at Chelsea Piers Fitness. “If you can do both, I would.”
But, if you are chasing a specific goal—full-body toning, a stronger core, maximum burn—here’s how the two stack up against each other.
Meet the experts:
Rachelle Reed
, PhD, is an exercise scientist and Pure Barre instructor based in Athens, GA.
Kathy Bambace Salvo
, is a certified yoga, barre, and Pilates instructor and the director of Evolve Yoga, Pilates & Barre at Chelsea Piers Fitness.
What’s the difference between barre and Pilates?
Barre and Pilates are both
low-impact
workouts, suitable for most fitness levels, and utilize small, precise movements to fatigue your muscles. “They really are so similar,” says Bambace Salvo. And, their similarities aren’t a big surprise. “Lotte Berk—the inventor of barre—did a lot of Pilates,” says Bambace Salvo. In fact, the core section of your barre class? That’s Pilates.
One big difference: The music. A barre class is typically taught around its playlist, says Rachelle Reed, PhD, an exercise scientist and Pure Barre instructor of over ten years. You’re meant to move with the beat, and this might even help the class fly by just that much quicker, according to research. Exercising to music both makes the workout feel easier and boosts muscle activation, per a 2021 review in the
Journal of Functional Morphology and Kinesiology
. Meanwhile, Pilates, similar to yoga, is more focused on following the breath, also allowing it to promote better body awareness, says Bambace Salvo.
You’ll also find that where a Pilates class mostly works your
core
, barre is a
full-body workout
that gives time to your legs, glutes, core, and arms equally—on top of some
cardio
, says Reed. Plus, the equipment is going to look pretty different. While Pilates can be done without it, the modality is known for its
reformer
: That big, sliding contraption with springs that add resistance and challenge to the workout. Barre is known for its ballerina bar where you’ll do pliés until you really feel the burn.

Which is better for core strength?
If building
core strength
is your goal, Pilates is the choice for you, say both experts. After all, the modality is pretty much entirely focused on that part of the body. There are so many benefits to this, says Bambace Salvo. Pilates really targets all the muscles in your core, improving flexibility, posture, and even breathing. “You walk out of that class feeling taller,” she says.
Because Pilates is so effective at strengthening your core, it can even be used to help relieve
lower back pain
(which can in part be caused by a weak core), per
a 2023 review in
Healthcare
.
Which offers more total-body toning?
Both barre and Pilates fall under the category of “sculpt” classes—but barre might be better at sculpting, say our experts. Barre tends to use high reps and low weight, which is a great way to build up
endurance
and get light muscle definition, says Bambace Salvo. Plus, barre is full-body—and mainly targets the areas people are looking to define—on top of having some cardio, which is a perfect combo to get toned.
As for building strength and muscle growth (a.k.a.
hypertrophy
), she’s not as convinced. But, it really comes down to how much
resistance
you’re incorporating. Some barre classes allow for heavier weights, even up to 25 pounds, which should do the trick, says Reed. Just remember that both barre and Pilates have their limit long-term as to how much muscle you can actually put on because they predominantly work with bodyweight and light resistance.

Which burns more calories?
When it comes to which modality burns more calories, barre is the clear winner, Reed and Bambace Salvo agree. This is mostly because, while both classes are low-impact, barre is a little more demanding on your body and heart. Keeping that heart rate elevated will lead to more calories burned, says Reed.
Everyone is different, but you can expect to burn anywhere from 100 to 300 extra calories in a barre class, per Bambace Salvo’s calculations.

Why Trust Us?
Cameron Diaz
stepped away from acting back in 2014, but now, she's officially back—well,
Back in Action
.
The Netflix film, which also stars
Jamie Foxx
, stars the two actors as parents who used to be secret agents. But the couple finds themselves back at work when their cover is blown.
For Cameron, taking a break from acting “was something I just had to do," she said at
Fortune
’s Most Powerful Women Summit in October, per
The Hollywood Reporter
.
"It felt like the right thing for me to do to reclaim my own life and I just really didn’t care about anything else.” (In the meantime, the 52-year-old welcomed two children,
reportedly via surrogate
, alongside husband Benji Madden.)
While you're watching Cameron run around on-screen, it's fair to wonder what she does to be in such amazing shape. While Cameron is famously pretty private about her personal life, she’s shared a few things over the years. Here’s what to know.
She loves interval training—that only takes five minutes.
Cameron loves cardio—but the "right" kind of
cardio
, she said told
OWN
back in 2016. For the actress, that means
interval training
.
"Some people can get on the cardio machine and go for two hours at the same pace—it's the same sweat, just a nice little glisten," she said. "You want to be a fire hydrant in New York City that just got busted open, and you're pouring out after and everybody gets wet. That's the kind of cardio you want to do."

Cameron prefers to get her cardio done in just five minutes. "I just get on my elliptical and I do intervals," she said. "You sprint... for a minute. A whole minute. Then, you stop for a minute; you just kind of [jog to] bring your heart rate down. Let it come down, then a minute later... [sprint] for another minute.. Do that five times. You are bursting with sweat."
She works out with trainer Teddy Bass nearly every day.
The actress works out with trainer Teddy Bass nearly every day, according to
The Sun
. The two work through a mix of
strength training
,
HIIT
, and
Pilates
exercises together.
It's important for Cameron to show up for workouts. “Some days I go to the gym for literally 10 minutes. But the fact that I got up and got there matters to me,” she told
Self
in 2014
. “Because at the end of all of this, I want to be able to say, ‘I did the best I could.’ It’s not about having a ripped stomach. It’s about taking care of myself.”
She ‘transformed’ her body for ‘Charlie’s Angels.’
Cameron grew up eating junk food, she told
USA Today
.
While she changed her eating habits as a young adult, Cameron didn’t do much exercise until she started training for
Charlie’s Angels
when she was 27. During training, Cameron said she morphed from having a “skinny frame” to “a strong powerful body.”

“It felt amazing. I watched my body transform over a week of intense training—some days doing upward of 1,500 to 2,000 kicks a day,” she said. “Kicking, kicking, kicking for eight hours. All of a sudden, I had six-pack abs. It was painful. I would not recommend that anyone blast their body like that. It was an intense, physical challenge. But it woke me up to my own body and what it was capable of.”
Cameron kept up an exercise routine after that. “I went to the gym this morning. I did cardio. I went on the elliptical for half an hour. Sometimes I do the treadmill. I do a mile as fast as I can go,” she said.

She exercises for her longevity.
Cameron wants to be as healthy as possible for as long as possible. “I want to make sure I don't get sick,” she told
USA Today
. “If I'm blessed to get older, I want to make sure I can maintain quality of life.”
So glad you're back, Cameron!

Everything You Need To Know About Cortisol And Exercise—And What It Means For Your Training
Everything You Need To Know About Cortisol And Exercise—And What It Means For Your Training
The hormone gets a bad rap, but it's actually key for your gains.

If you’ve scrolled through social media lately, you may have seen some
chatter about cortisol
—a stress hormone—and its supposed villainous effects on your body. Negative effects of
cortisol
have been dubbed terms like “
cortisol face
” or “moon face” (a puffy appearance blamed on high cortisol stores in the body) and have sparked fear and confusion, leaving many women wondering if workout routines and activities that temporarily raise cortisol levels, such as
weight lifting
, do more harm than good.
The truth? “Cortisol is a key hormone that helps our bodies adapt to all types of stressors, including exercise,” says Amber Wheeler, MD, a general endocrinologist. Regular, moderate exercise-induced cortisol spikes are not only normal, but also
essential
for building a healthier, stronger, more resilient body. When managed appropriately, cortisol is a natural, beneficial hormone that helps you adapt and thrive—both in fitness and in life, adds Alexander Rothstein, EdD, CSCS, an exercise physiologist, strength coach, and educator.
Below, hormone and exercise experts help unpack the relationship between exercise and cortisol, why the
stress
hormone shouldn’t be feared, and how to balance your fitness routine to harness its benefits without overdoing it.
Meet the experts:
Amber Wheeler
, MD,
hey freya
Medical Advisor and General Endocrinologist.
Alexander Rothstein
, CSCS, ACSM-EP, is an exercise physiologist and instructor for the exercise science program at New York Institute of Technology.
Roxie Jones
, CPT, is a strength and nutrition coach at
Body Rox
.
The Role Of Cortisol In Exercise—And Why It's Not The Enemy
Cortisol is your body’s main stress hormone—it kicks in whenever you’re dealing with stress, including the physical stress of working out, says Rothstein. “The nickname ‘stress hormone’ creates a negative association with cortisol, but that couldn’t be further from the truth,” he says.
Often called the “
fight or flight
” hormone, it’s naturally released when you encounter a challenge—whether it’s a tough workout or a stressful workday—to help you power through. During exercise, cortisol helps fuel your muscles and manage physical stress by breaking down stored carbohydrates (a.k.a. glycogen) and fat, giving your body the energy it needs to perform.
Beyond fueling your workouts, cortisol supports recovery by managing inflammation and repairing muscle tissue, according to a study in
Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America
. “Cortisol helps mobilize energy stores and repair muscle tissue after exercise,” says Rothstein. So, it’s a normal and necessary part of the process. Over time, regular exercise-induced cortisol spikes also help your body
build resilience
, making you stronger both physically and mentally. Exercise trains not just your muscles but your nervous and endocrine systems as well, teaching your body how to regulate cortisol appropriately, he says.
What cortisol does:
Manages stress
Regulates metabolism
Controls inflammation
Maintains blood sugar
Supports blood pressure
Facilitates natural circadian rhythm
Repairs muscle tissue
Moderate-intensity exercise can significantly increase cortisol levels temporarily, which helps your body adapt and thrive over time, while low-intensity exercise tends to have minimal impact. Very
high-intensity exercise
causes dramatic spikes, according to a study in the
Journal of Exercise and Nutrition
. In the study, moderate-intensity exercise led to significant cortisol increases, while high-intensity exercise caused dramatic spikes—up to 80 percent higher than baseline. Meanwhile, low-intensity exercise didn’t raise cortisol levels much at all and sometimes even reduced them. Interestingly,
aerobic workouts
, especially long and intense ones, tend to spike cortisol more than
resistance training
, according to the study.

Aside from the type of workout you’re doing, other things that can affect how much cortisol your body pumps out include age, gender, and fitness level, says Rothstein. Plus, as we get older, our bodies respond differently to exercise, and men and women can experience those cortisol changes in unique ways.
Beyond its role in stress, cortisol fluctuations are an important part of regulating blood sugar, metabolism, and inflammation, and cortisol supports recovery after physical exertion, according to
Stat Pearls
. It’s also part of your body’s natural daily rhythm, peaking in the morning to help you wake up and gradually tapering off throughout the day.
Now, how hard and how long you exercise makes a big difference in how cortisol affects your body and your muscle health. A little rise in cortisol during exercise is beneficial, but too much—such as from prolonged or overly intense workouts—can tip the scale, leading to muscle breakdown. “Cortisol is not inherently bad,” Rothstein says. “The key is allowing your body enough
recovery
time to balance the catabolic (breakdown) and anabolic (build-up) phases of exercise.”
When to test cortisol levels:
For most average people without specific symptoms such as chronic fatigue or unexplained weight changes, cortisol testing usually isn’t necessary. Cortisol naturally fluctuates throughout the day, and a single blood test may not tell you much. Testing is more beneficial when there’s a clinical suspicion of a medical condition or if symptoms significantly impact daily life.
This is particularly a concern for those already at risk of muscle loss, such as older adults or individuals with certain health conditions. However, most people aren’t exercising at a consistent enough intensity or duration to worry about cortisol causing negative effects, according to a meta-analysis in
Trends in Sports Sciences
that examined more than 40 existing studies regarding the role of cortisol in exercise. For moderate exercisers, the study showed these temporary spikes are a positive signal for your body to adapt and grow. Without these cortisol responses, your progress could stall.
Why Cortisol Gets A Bad Rap When It Comes To Bloating And Inflammation
One of the biggest myths circulating online is the idea that exercise-induced spikes in cortisol cause “cortisol face” or “moon face”—a puffy, swollen appearance assumed to be caused by elevated cortisol levels. While chronic stress and persistently high cortisol can contribute to fluid retention and inflammation over time, short-term increases in cortisol as a response to exercise don’t have the same effect, according to the same
Trends in Sports Sciences
review referenced earlier. “Cortisol face is not a common occurrence in healthy individuals unless there’s an underlying hormone disorder or medication like corticosteroids involved,” says Rothstein.
Most people aren’t exercising at a consistent enough intensity or duration to worry about cortisol causing negative effects.
Short-term increases from exercise, as seen in studies of low- and moderate-intensity workouts, are unlikely to cause visible puffiness, especially when balanced with good recovery habits. The causes behind puffiness or
bloating
are often varied and multifactorial, but it’s likely caused by other factors such as
dehydration
, poor sleep, or a high-sodium diet—not necessarily your workout routine, says Rothstein. Prioritizing good recovery and overall wellness habits, like staying hydrated, getting enough rest, and eating plenty of protein and fiber helps keep cortisol levels in check and minimizes these effects.
So, next time you hear about “cortisol face” or other myths, remember: Stress, when managed well, makes you stronger.
Signs You Might Be Overdoing It
While moderate exercise-induced cortisol can help you crush your workouts and reach your fitness goals, too much of a good thing can lead to problems. Chronic
overtraining
—though uncommon for most exercisers—can cause consistently elevated cortisol levels, which might result in symptoms like:
Fatigue or feeling run down
Trouble sleeping or staying asleep
Frequent colds or illnesses
Difficulty recovering between workouts
For those wondering if cortisol causes
weight gain
, the answer is nuanced. Persistent high cortisol levels can lead to increased appetite or fat storage, but exercise-induced spikes are short-lived and unlikely to have this effect, according to
research
. “Cortisol becomes problematic when it's persistently elevated due to overtraining or insufficient recovery,” says Dr. Wheeler. “Signs include fatigue that doesn’t improve with rest, decreased performance, trouble sleeping, irritability, and frequent illness.” If you’re experiencing symptoms of overtraining or exercise begins to feel draining rather than energizing, listen to your body and reassess intensity or incorporate more rest days into your routine.
“I help clients experiencing high cortisol avoid overtraining by scheduling two to three days of moderate intensity strength training while promoting parasympathetic-forward activities outside of the gym such as
walking
, breath work, and
meditation
,” says Roxie Jones, CPT, a strength and nutrition coach. “Training intensity can always be adjusted to help manage stress better.”

Tips To Keep Cortisol In A Healthy Range
Your biggest takeaway: Cortisol is only problematic when it’s chronically elevated—and balance is the key to managing it, says Rothstein. Focusing on healthy habits—like stress reduction techniques, consistent exercise, a balanced diet, and adequate sleep—often brings cortisol into balance naturally. Here are some simple strategies experts recommend to keep this hormone working for you, not against you:
Practice mindfulness
. Activities like yoga, meditation, or even deep breathing can reduce overall stress and lower cortisol levels, say Rothstein and Jones.
Prioritize recovery.
Schedule regular rest days and use tools like foam rolling or stretching to help your body recover, says Rothstein.
Balance workout intensity.
Integrating two to three low- to moderate-intensity sessions per week is an excellent way to manage overall cortisol levels while staying on track with your fitness goals, says Jones.
Fuel thoughtfully.
Eating a protein-rich snack after exercise helps regulate blood sugar and mitigate cortisol’s effects, says Rothstein. (Think: Greek yogurt with berries or a protein shake.)
Do your best to maintain a healthy, consistent sleep routine.
Aim for seven to nine hours of quality sleep each night. Poor sleep can disrupt cortisol’s natural rhythm, says Jones.

Why Trust Us?
Remember all those sketchy years during which women were told to shy away from weights? Now, finally, the tides are turning in a major way, with the fitness and health industries not only celebrating, but also encouraging, women adding resistance training to their routines for the endless mind and body benefits. One of the clearest upsides of weight training for women lies in the powerful way it increases metabolism and kicks weight loss into high gear.
“Strength training improves body composition by reducing body fat while maintaining or increasing lean muscle mass,” says sports dietitian Tiffany Ma, RDN. “It also supports long-term weight management by enhancing your metabolic rate and physical function, making it easier to stay active.” Basically, taking up a lifting habit can help you to get stronger and even give your metabolism a boost, allowing you to burn calories more efficiently in the future.
You don't need to spent years pumping iron to see results, either:
Research
has shown that a six-week strength training program can help you lose body fat and gain muscle.
Of course, weight loss is complicated, and consistent strength training paired with a well-balanced diet and other healthy lifestyle habits will ultimately lasting impact when it comes to weight loss.
If you've never done a formal strength training program in the past, it's understandable to have questions about how weight training for weight loss works, and what a solid schedule looksl ike. Here's how experts recommend incorporating weight training into your routine if weight loss is your goal.
Meet the experts:
Kerry Ann Madden
, NASM-CPT, is the owner of KAM Fitness and Nutrition.
Stacy Sims,
PhD, is an exercise physiologist and senior research associate at SPRINZ-AUT University.
Alex Silver-Fagan
, CPT, RYT, is a Nike master trainer.
Tiffany Ma,
RDN, CSSD, is a sports dietitian and former competitive powerlifter based in New York City.
Why Weight Training For Weight Loss Works
In addition to helping you build muscle, weight training can help with fat loss, especially if you’re using free weights (think: dumbbells, kettlebells, and barbells) and engaging in circuit training, says Kerry Ann Madden, NASM-CPT, owner of KAM Fitness and Nutrition. So, if you like to stay active and want to enhance your results, it may help to mix up your existing workout routine with exercises that will help you build strength (more on that soon).
In the past, you may have heard that cardio and calorie restriction can help you lose weight quickly, but this isn’t necessarily true. Why? First, instances of increased stress—from, say, cardio-heavy workouts—can cause your body’s
cortisol levels
(the stress hormone that regulates your metabolism) to skyrocket. Stress and obesity are interrelated, per research in the
International Journal of Preventive Medicine
, and being on a strict diet may expose a person to stress and therefore increase cortisol levels even more, per a study in the
Journal of Nutrition and Food Security
. Because cortisol
helps regulate your metabolism
, engaging in activity that regularly spikes your cortisol may not be best if you’re trying to lose weight.
“With resistance training, you're actually building muscle tissue, and it's not quite as taxing—so you don't get that cortisol bump,” says exercise physiologist Stacy Sims, PhD. Lifting weights also makes your muscles more efficient overall, she says. That said, you don't necessarily need to abandon cardio altogether since it can still support weight loss
. You don't need to put pressure on yourself to focus on
exclusively
cardio or overdo it—g
etting 150 minutes of moderate intensity activity per week (even brisk walking) is enough.
You may not notice significant weight loss when you first start lifting weights. "You'll start noticing a change in your clothes, you'll start feeling fitter, you'll start looking toner—but the weight on the scale might not change," Sims says. This is because your body composition is changing—you’re losing fat while building muscle mass, and muscles are incredibly dense. So if the number on the scale doesn’t change right away, don’t give up on your workout routine—it may just take some time to see a shift, she says.

Assess your mobility.
Before you pick up any weights, it's a good idea to understand what your body's mobility and stability looks like, according to Alex Silver-Fagan, CPT, RYT, a Nike master trainer and the creator of Flow Into Strong. Try hanging on a bar,
holding a plank,
or sitting in a squat. "If you can't hold your body in those places, I wouldn't add load to those movements," she says. Keep working at these exercises with your body weight until you feel more in control, she says.
Master the basics.
There are four functional moves you should be able to conquer before starting your weight training routine: a squat, push-up,
deadlift,
and horizontal or overhead row, says Silver-Fagan. Having these under your belt will help prevent injuries in the future. Not sure how your form stacks up? Consider working with a trainer for even just a few sessions (virtual or IRL) for feedback and guidance.
Use different types of weights.
To start, find three sets of dumbbells: a light, medium, and heavy pair, says Silver-Fagan. You should be able to easily lift the lightest ones with little to no effort, while the heavy ones should be tougher. (Sometimes, even your own body weight can be enough, she adds, so start where you're most comfortable.)
If you aren't sure how light or heavy your weights should be when you're first starting out, choose one that feels "medium-light" to you and perform 12 reps of foundational movements: squats, presses, rows, lunges, and deadlifts, says Madden. "Next, ask yourself, 'Could I have done more than 12'? If yes, that weight is a great starting point for stabilization endurance training," she says.

Alternate strength and cardio.
If you're not currently exercising or have been taking a break for a while, you should start with one day of strength training and another of cardio, says Madden. "Exercise will create positive changes in your body that may take four to six weeks to feel," Madden says. "From there, you can increase to three days of weight training and four days of cardio if your body is loving it. Learning your perfect plan is part of the fun!"
Eat plenty of protein.
Eating enough
protein
is important for muscle growth and repair, and also helps you feel fuller longer, which could help you lose weight in the long run, says Ma.
The current (bare minimum!) recommendation is 0.35 grams of protein per pound of body weight every day if you're sedentary, per
The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics
—however, it's likely that you need much more, especially when incorporating strength training into your routine. If you're active and looking to build muscle and lower your body fat percentage, aim for more like 0.73 to 1 grams of protein per pound of body weight, per the
National Academy of Sports Medicine
. For most of us, that's about 30 to 35 grams of protein per meal.
Listen to your body.
Pay attention to how you're feeling while lifting weights. "There's a difference between pain and discomfort," Silver-Fagan notes. "If something is painful, then you should be backing off. If something's uncomfortable, you have to ask yourself, 'Is this because I haven't done it? Is it hard?' "
Remember that you can always take a break in between reps, and it's important to prioritize rest and recovery, too. "Ensure you get enough sleep, manage stress, and allow your muscles to recover properly between workouts," Ma says.
Weight Training For Weight Loss Sample Plan
These three workouts are easy to fit into your current fitness routine.
Equipment:
Hand weights or dumbbells
Best for:
Total-body strength
Instructions:
Do each of these three workouts once a week for four weeks. Each new week, try to either use a heavier weight or do more reps, Silver-Fagan suggests. Combine with one to two cardio days (jogging, walking, rower, cycling,
Tabata
,
HIIT
—whatever you enjoy that gets your heart rate up!), one to two
yoga days,
and a
rest day
for the best results. She also recommends
warming up
by moving through the exercises without weights first.

How to:
Place two dumbbells on the floor shoulder width apart. Assume a plank position with feet wider than shoulder-distance apart. Grasp the dumbbells so hands are elevated off the floor, maintaining a neutral wrist position.
Drive left arm through the dumbbell into the floor, brace entire body, and row the right dumbbell up and to the side of rib cage—your elbow should be pointed up and back.
Keep your body stable as you slowly lower the dumbbell back to the floor. Then repeat on the other side.
That’s 1 rep.
Complete 12 alternating reps with a medium weight.
Russian Twist
How to:
Sit on floor with legs together out in front of you, knees bent. Hold a dumbbell or medicine ball for added challenge. Lean back slightly so your torso and legs form a V-like shape, bracing abdominals.
Twist torso from one side, then the other, without moving legs.
That's 1 rep.
Complete 16 reps.
Workout 2
Complete five sets total of the next two exercises.
Deadlift
How to:
Stand with feet shoulder-distance apart, with a dumbbell in each hand.
Hinge at hips and lower torso, with a slight bend in knees, until torso is parallel to floor (or as far as you can without your spine rounding). Keep spine neutral by looking forward, not up.
Keep shoulders back and engage glutes and core as you drive through lower body to stand up straight.
That's 1 rep.
Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower back down into next rep. Complete three to five reps with a heavy weight.
Chest Press
How to:
Lie flat on back, or on a bench, with feet flat on the ground. With a dumbbell in each hand, extend arms directly over shoulders, palms facing toward feet.
Squeeze shoulder blades together and slowly bend elbows, lowering the weights out to the side, parallel with shoulders, until elbows form 90-degree angles.
Slowly drive the dumbbells back up to start, squeezing shoulder blades the entire time.
That’s 1 rep.
Complete three to five reps with a medium-heavy weight.
Complete four sets total of the next three exercises.
Kettlebell Swing
How to:
Hold a kettlebell with both hands using an overhand grip and stand with feet hip-width apart. Push hips back, knees slightly bent, and lower butt and chest and bring the weight slightly in front of feet.
Keeping core tight, lift pull the kettlebell slightly back between your legs, then drive hips forward to accelerate the kettlebell up to shoulder height.
Reverse the movement, lowering the weight back between your legs.
That's 1 rep.
Complete 10 reps.
Split Stance Shoulder Press
How to:
Grab a pair of dumbbells or a resistance band. Stagger stance into a wide step, one foot forward and one back with hips squared, and hold the weights or band just above shoulders, elbows close to sides.
Leaning forward ever so slightly, bend both knees, and press through front heel while simultaneously lifting the weights or band to the sky, keeping elbows forward and arms in line with your ears.
Lower weights or band back to shoulders.
That's 1 rep.
Do 10 reps, alternating side for each set.
Turkish Get Up
How to:
Lie face-up with kettlebell in left hand resting in front of shoulder. Bend left leg, placing foot flat on floor. Stretch out right arm and leg to the side at a 45-degree angle.
Get a good grip on handle and press weight up toward ceiling, locking out elbow completely and keeping gaze on kettlebell.
With eyes still on bell overhead, rise onto right forearm, then push into palm of right hand to sit up straight. Engage abs, then push through left heel and squeeze glutes to lift hips and step right leg behind into lunge, so right knee is down and left thigh is parallel to floor. (
Note
: You can stop at this step to modify the move.)
Brace core and drive through glutes to stand if you can.
Reverse the steps until you are lying on the floor again.
That's 1 rep.
Complete five reps with a medium weight on each side.
Workout 3
Complete three sets total of the next two exercises.
Single-Leg Deadlift
How to:
Stand with both feet under hips. Shift weight to right leg, which should be straight with a soft bend in the knee.
Begin to drive left foot back like you're stamping the bottom of your foot on the wall behind you, keeping leg straight. Simultaneously, slowly start hinging at the waist, tipping torso forward until it’s almost parallel to the floor. Keep your arms straight, at shoulder height, and perpendicular to the floor.
At the bottom of the position, your body should be in a straight line from the top of head to the bottom of left foot.
Then, begin pulling left leg forward while keeping it straight, and lift your torso up until you’re standing again.
That’s 1 rep.
Complete 10 reps.
Kneeling Chest Press To Tricep Extension
How to:
Start kneeling with knees slightly wider than hip-distance apart.
Hold a dumbbell in both hands and extend arms straight out in front of chest.
Bend at elbows to pull dumbbell toward chest, then press arms back out to straight.
Next, raise the dumbbell up overhead, and bend at elbows to lower weight behind head.
Finally, extend elbows to press dumbbell back up overhead and reverse the movement to return to starting position.
That's 1 rep.
Complete 12 reps with a medium weight.
Complete four sets total of the next three exercises.
Squat To Overhead Press With Rotation
How to:
Start standing with feet shoulder-width apart and engage core. Rack weights at shoulders.
Lower into a squat.
Once you’ve lowered as your mobility will allow (ideally, thighs will be parallel to the floor), drive through heels to return to standing.
As you come up, push the weights overhead, keeping your knees soft, and rotate torso simultaneously.
That's 1 rep.
Complete ten reps, alternating the direction you twist each time, with a medium weight.
Alternating Reverse Lunge To Bicep Curl
How to:
Grab a pair of dumbbells and hold them at arm's length next to sides, palms facing each other. Stand tall with feet hip-width apart.
Step backward with right leg and lower body until front knee is bent 90 degrees. At the same time as you lunge, curl both dumbbells up to shoulders.
Lower the dumbbells as you return to the starting position. Step back with the other leg and repeat.
That's 1 rep.
Complete 12 reps with a medium weight.
Rainbow Slam
How to:
Start in a lunge with both knees at 90-degree angles. Hold a dumbbell or medicine ball in both hands.
Rotate upper body slightly and extend arms so you're holding weight toward one side of body. Forcefully, but with control, swing the weight over head in an arch or rainbow shape, until you reach the same position on the opposite side of body.
Bring weight back to starting position.
That's 1 rep.
Complete 16 reps with a medium weight on one side, then switch.

Why Trust Us?
If there’s one thing to know about me, it’s that I am a huge proponent of barre. This low-impact modality—created by a
ballerina
and a mix between
Pilates
,
yoga
, and
strength training
—is one sure-fire way to challenge yourself and work muscles you didn’t know you had, all while set to a killer playlist that keeps you motivated.
I never really felt at home in group fitness classes until I had my first session at
Barre3
. Showing up to the airy studio, I was greeted by smiling faces and asked if I had any injuries my instructor should know about. (A major thing I love about barre: That there are *plenty* of modifications for all kinds of needs.) I grabbed my
light weights
,
resistance bands
, and a towel for good measure, and by the time my 45 minute candlelight class was over, I had pulsed, plied, and squatted my way through an energizing full-body workout—and I was hooked.
Meet the experts:
Katelyn DiGiorgio is the VP of training and technique and master teacher trainer at
Pure Barre.
Kara Liotta, CPT, is the co-founder of
KKSWEAT
, a barre and HIIT studio in New York City.
Rachelle Reed
, PhD, is an exercise scientist and Pure Barre instructor based in Athens, GA.
Whether you’re a fitness class vet or a total newbie like I was, there’s something for everyone at a barre class. Convinced to give it a try? Here’s what you can expect in your first class.
What To Expect In A Barre Workout Class
Each barre class is roughly 45 to 60 minutes and designed to be a full-body,
muscle endurance
workout (as I've
definitely
experienced). Typically, they're broken into different sections that focus on major muscle groups including the arms, legs, glutes, and core.
"The muscles in each group are fatigued via small targeted movements, high numbers of repetitions, and light weight or resistance," says DiGiorgio. Think:
pulsing
in a squat to target the glutes and quads, cranking out as many triceps kickbacks as possible with three-pound weights, or moving through a lively plank sequence.
"Barre class is a workout technique inspired by elements of ballet, yoga, and Pilates," says DiGiorgio. "It focuses on low-impact, high-intensity movements designed to strengthen your body in ways that few other workouts can."
One way barre achieves that intensity is through
isometric exercises
, or holding a static position. “The idea here is that holding something in good form—and making it through the whole series that way—is building time under tension,” says Rachelle Reed, PhD, an exercise scientist and a Pure Barre instructor for over ten years. “It’s a way to use the principle of progressive overload to build strength without lifting weights.”
In addition to
building strength
, this
full-body workout
also develops agility and flexibility by incorporating stretching, DiGiorgio adds. In some classes, you'll use just the barre (or equivalent like a countertop or chair back) and your body weight to churn out rep after rep of muscle-burning move, while others incorporate tools like resistance bands, sliders, ankle weights, free weights, exercise balls, and more. But don’t let the fancy equipment fool you. Barre is a very practical workout. “I think of barre as being in the category of functional fitness because so many things that we do in barre mimic movements that we need to do in real life,” says Reed.

Benefits Of Barre Workouts
There are many perks that come with dabbling in barre classes to supplement your other training or making them your go-to workouts.
Increased flexibility and mobility.
Borrowing from ballet and all the flexibility that dancers need, barre classes also can help improve your stretchiness. “Some exercises can involve a bit of mobility, particularly in your hips,” says Kara Liotta, the co-founder of
KKSWEAT
. She also notes that beyond the specific ballet-inspired moves, you’ll also get a fair amount of stretching in most Barre workouts to stretch out the muscles you’ll be exhausting.
Increased muscle strength.
Any form of resistance training—
calisthenics
, weight lifting, and barre—will increase muscle mass.
Studies
show that yes, intensity or added weight builds muscle, but so can volume, which is what barre is all about. Oh, and because so many of the moves you'll work through in class get your abs and back fired up, you can bet you'll sculpt a stronger, more defined core, DiGiorgio adds. (And, BTW, doing strength training and building muscle also has benefits for your
bone density
.)
Improved
endurance.
“Barre workouts are all about endurance, form, and repetition,” says Liotta. “You hold positions for a long time and exhaust reps, but with minimal weight.”  Because you are spending a good amount of time in each shape to really wear out the muscles, you also can truly feel what part of your body you are supposed to be activating and strengthening.
They're gentle on joints.
Barre classes are
low-impact
, which can reduce the risk of injury and help if you are already injured. “Many people are working with injuries and still want a solid physical challenge without feeling like they have to modify everything,” says Liotta. “Barre is low-impact because there is no jumping whatsoever in a traditional barre workout.” That also makes it a great option for pre- and postnatal women, DiGiorgio says.
Better posture.
So many of the moves in a barre class also target your abs and core. So not only can you work toward a stronger, more defined core, you’ll also be gaining solid strength to improve your posture, balance, and overall agility.
Improved lower back pain.
Because of barre’s core-strengthening and posture-improving abilities, it can lead to reduced lower back pain, says Reed.
Great for cross training.
You don't have to go all in on barre to feel the effects. Even if your primary focus is on getting ready for a race, barre class can be a great form of
cross-training
to maintain strength and well-rounded fitness, DiGiorgio says.
Strengthened pelvic floor.
Another part of your body that barre works? Your pelvic floor, says Reed. For this reason, she also says it could be a good option for pregnant people looking to get active, assuming they talk to their doctors first. “I taught and took bar throughout both of my pregnancies and postpartum experiences,” says Reed. “Because it's low impact and so good for pelvic floor training, I felt so strong and prepared for both.” Psst: One small,
observational study from 2023
found that—among the 25 women with urinary incontinence issues they surveyed—all saw significant improvement after ten Pure Barre sessions.

How Barre Compares To Other Workouts
For starters, barre is for everyone, and you don't have to be a dancer or super-fit to do it. "The community is made of people who have tried every fitness class ever created, as well as those just starting their fitness journey," says DiGiorgio. "Unlike many exercise programs, which require a high level of physical fitness or prior expertise, barre is very beginner-friendly and adaptable to different skill sets and ability levels."
"Barre is very beginner-friendly and adaptable to different skill sets and ability levels."
Still, it may take a few classes before you hit your groove at the barre. "Class moves quickly, and can be challenging, since you’ll utilize muscles you never knew you had," says DiGiorgio. "But you’ll get the hang of it after three or four classes, and you'll generally see results in just eight to 10."
In a barre class, expect to be
moving to upbeat music
, unlike Pilates, where you will be mostly relying on breath cues. This has its benefits, says Reed. Working out to music not only helps you psychologically, making your
rate of perceived exertion
feel lower, but it could also help you physically by boosting muscle activation, per a 2021 review in the
Journal of Functional Morphology and Kinesiology
.

Plus, the newer "fusion" variations of barre classes have different goals and may remind you of other modalities you've tried. Pure Barre's Pure Empower class, for example, combines traditional barre moves with interval training, so you get your heart rate up to get your cardio in, too. Other fusion classes, meanwhile, use more weights and resistance tools to up the ante, like Barre3's Strength class.
What To Wear To Barre Class
While workout outfits are totally based on personal preference, DiGiorgio recommends wearing leggings or capris that you feel comfortable in and a workout tank or T-shirt to barre class.
Wearing clothes that fit close to your body also helps your instructor get a better view of your form (if you're taking a Zoom or Google Hangout class or have access to an IRL instructor) throughout class so they can give you advice on any necessary adjustments.
You'll also want to wear
sticky socks
to prevent your feet from sliding. (Trust me, this one is essential.)

Barre Class
Form Tips
There's a lot of new lingo to learn when you step in the studio. Here are the terms you need to know to keep your form on point and make the most of your hard work.
Pulse:
In your first class, "one of the more challenging form essentials to grasp is the idea of small, controlled movements," says DiGiorgio. "When you hear your teacher say pulse, for example, that literally means just move an inch up and down." The goal here is to focus on contracting the target muscle, which requires keeping your range of motion controlled, precise, and small.
Shaking:
Don’t be alarmed during your first barre class if you’re trying to hold a position and your leg suddenly starts shaking. It’s par for the course in this modality. Remember how barre is all about high-volume repetitions, small movements, and isometric holds? “As your muscles fatigue and start running out of energy, they get shaky and less stable,” says Reed, meaning holding that position just got a whole lot harder. Shaking means you’re doing the move right.
Tuck your tailbone:
If the instructor says this, or have a "heavy tailbone," draw your abs inward and roll your hips under slightly to create a neutral spine, says DiGiorgio. This position promotes core engagement, and comes up a lot throughout class.
Remember, if you don’t catch on after your first try, don’t get discouraged! You'll learn the lingo and moves after a few classes, DiGiorgio says.

How strength training helped the singer, 31, slim down and feel stronger.

Singer
Meghan Trainor
had a huge 2024: Not only did she release her sixth studio album
Timeless
, but she
embarked on her first headlining concert tour in over seven years. But in doing so, the mom-of-two, 31, realized that she needed to majorly overhaul her
workout routine
.
Meghan wanted to feel "fit" for her shows, she previously told
People
.
So, she got into
strength training
—and lost some weight in the process.
"I just look at all the years that I wasted doing hard cardio or trying to be a runner. My body was always just angry and inflamed. I was like, 'What's wrong with me? Why can't I do this?'" Meghan exclusively told
Women's Health
while chatting about her partnership with Bobbie.
"I know now that my body enjoys lifting weights and it doesn't make you big and bulky."
Luckily, she immediately saw results. "On tour, I lost even more weight and I got stronger, so I could do the show and it was easier at the end," she says. "I could still wake up at 7:00 a.m. and chase after my kids all day at a park while we were traveling. I definitely saw the benefits."
Here's Meghan's new routine—plus, why she wants to "grow [her] butt back" after losing weight.
She strength trains three times a week with husband Daryl Sabara.
Meghan and her husband Daryl hit the gym three times a week at 9 a.m. But if she doesn't have time for a formal sweat sesh, she'll use an
Apple Watch
to track her steps and get some in while cleaning her house.
"I've been begging [Daryl] to join me so I'm not alone," she says. "It's funny, I do hard stuff and he's like, 'I don't want to work that hard.' I'm like, 'But you should!'"

Inside Meghan Trainor's Weight Loss Journey
Typically, the couple's nanny will watch their sons, Riley, 3, and Barry, 1, while they're in their home gym. But they always stop by to watch their parents working hard, even lifting some "pretend kid weights" while they're at it.
"They always pick them up and go, 'Wow, look how strong we are!' I'm like, 'Do your lifts, do your squats.' And then they leave," she says. "I'm like, 'Get out of here, it's dangerous!'"
She's 'trying to grow my butt back' after her weight loss.
Lately, Meghan has been working out with a singular goal in mind:
booty gains.
"I'm trying to grow my butt back, because I lost so much weight that my booty is looking different," she says. "I was like, 'Wait. I'm the 'Bass' girl with a big butt!'"
To grow her butt, Meghan's been trying to "lift heavier and do glute activities," but those tend to activate her
sciatica
, which began during her pregnancies. "I'm in a weird pickle of trying to be more flexible and trying to do a lot of glute stuff," she says. "That's my goal."
She's eating more protein to support her workouts.
Recently, Meghan's trainer told her that she needs to be eating
100 grams of protein
a day to boost her gym goals. And now, it's become a conversation topic amongst her team.
"My managers and I are always talking about like, 'Oh my God, this is how I got 30 grams of protein at lunch today,'" she said. "It's a goal and it's a dream when we actually hit our protein counts now."
For breakfast, Meghan typically eats two eggs and some organic turkey bacon. "I want to mix it up, but I'm such a creature of habit that we'll do the same thing every day," she says.
For lunches and dinners, Meghan and Daryl tend to lean towards recipes from any
meal delivery services
that pack in proteins and carbs. "I wish I knew how to cook. I make bland stuff," she says. "But my husband is a nerd about finding food delivery companies that give you protein and help you out with a journey like that. So we're always looking for a new one."
While on tour, Meghan is especially strict with her diet. "I couldn't ever eat anything super bad," she says. "We went to one restaurant and we loved it, but I noticed I had heartburn. I had to be very strict with my eating before shows especially, because I would be burping on stage!"
She takes care of her mental health.
To support all of this work, Meghan and Daryl make sure to get seven or eight hours of sleep. "When we put our kids to bed at night, my husband and I run to bed. We are in bed at eight," she says. "Sometimes we don't sleep until 10 and we'll have date night and watch movies, but we try to sleep as much as we can."
Sleep—and exercise—also help Meghan take care of her
mental health
, which is something that Meghan has struggled with throughout her adult life. She got her first panic attack when she was 22 and was nervous she'd get
postpartum depression
by the time she got pregnant with her older son Riley.

What To Know About Postpartum Anxiety
"I was hearing all these warnings about postpartum or depression during pregnancy and how hard it was, so I went in scared. But I'm glad I had all those panic attacks before, so I knew what I could expect," she says. "Going into my pregnancies, I was talking to a psychiatrist, a therapist, my family, my support team, my managers—everyone. I was like, 'All hands on deck! I need help!'"
Ultimately, Meghan decided (alongside her doctors) that she would continue her
antidepressant
throughout both pregnancies. But afterwards, she struggled with her self-esteem when she experienced issues
breastfeeding
. It's why she partnered with Bobbie, whose formula she used with both of her sons, to
get the word out
about the importance of taking care of your mental health postpartum. As part of the initiative, Meghan and Bobbie are offering 50 parents a "Bobbie Care Package," including gifts from companies like Care.com, DoorDash, Thrive Market, and more.

Meghan Trainor and her son Barry.
Overall, Meghan hopes that new moms ask for help, no matter where they can get it. "At least turn to a family member or a friend and ask for help," she says. "I do it all the time—daily!"

Weighted vests
are a sure-fire way to level up a workout and look like a total badass while you're at it it. The buzzy fitness accessory can turn up the heat of any exercise, whether you’re
wearing one on a walk
, during a
HIIT workout
, or
rocking it on a hike
. And there’s one other circumstance in which a weighted vest can be clutch: within your running training.
Adding resistance—and therefore intensity—to your
cardio
training can help strengthen all the muscles you need for running, from the ones in your leg to your heart, says Erica Coviello, owner and running coach at Run Fit Stoked. Plus, you can use a weighted vest during different parts of your training—not just during runs specifically.
Here’s everything you need to know about running with a weighted vest for maximum performance gains (and safety!).
Meet the experts:
Erica Coviello
, CPT, is a level 2 certified RRCA running coach and owner of
Run Fit Stoked
.
Ryan Glatt
, CPT, is the senior brain health coach and director of the FitBrain Program at
Pacific Neuroscience Institute
at Providence Saint John’s Health Center.
Bonnie Chien
, MD, is an orthopedic surgeon at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center.
Why Weighted Vests Are Beneficial For Runners
Weighted vests used on a run or during
cross training
can help you by boosting cardiovascular health, improving
bone density
, enhancing muscle tone, promoting better posture, and amping up the
calories you burn
, as
WH
reported previously
.
For runners in particular, a weighted vest can help you level up your runs simply because they increase the demand on your body, making your muscles and heart work harder, and in turn, stronger. “A weighted vest increases your load on your leg muscles, your joints, and all of your connective tissue,” says Coviello. “And when you add load, you're adding stress; when you add stress, that's when you learn to adapt to the stress, which is how change happens.”
Overall, running with a weighted vest today should make your next run without it that much easier. “The principle is to overload the neuromuscular system, prompting adaptations that improve running efficiency, strength, and balance—
especially
during subsequent unweighted activity,” says Ryan Glatt, CPT, director of the FitBrain Program at Pacific Neuroscience Institute at Providence Saint John’s Health Center.

3 Ways To Incorporate A Weighted Vest As A Runner
The beauty of a weighted vest is that it’s versatile. You have options for how to use one in your running plan. One thing to keep in mind: Just because they’re versatile doesn’t mean you need to wear your weighted vest every day. In fact, it might be best to gradually build up how long and how frequently you wear one, says Bonnie Chien, MD, an orthopedic surgeon at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center. “I would start shorter and smaller and build up from there to not rush into it,” she says.
Start with wearing your vest for 15 minutes once a week if you’re new to the tool, and incorporate it into your routine one to two times a week max. Some signs you might be overwearing your vest include joint pain, fatigue, or worsened performance, says Glatt. If you’re experiencing these issues, consider using your vest less or lightening your load. Otherwise, here are your options for wearing a weighted vest as a runner.
Cross-training:
Weighted vests can
amp up a walk
or
elliptical workout
on a cross-training day. Coviello likes this option because it’s low-impact—and you can probably comfortably keep the vest on for a longer period of time. Start out with a 30 to 40 minute session wearing your vest to get used to having the added weight.
Warm-ups:
Before you go out on a run, strap your vest on for a walking or slow-paced jog for 10 to 15 minutes. The added resistance should have you feeling warm in no time. (And, incorporating a weighted vest into a warm-up improves peak running speed and leg stiffness, according to an older study in the
Journal of Science and Medicine In Sport
.)
Runs:
You don’t want to wear a weighted vest on just any and every run, says Coviello. “I would never do it for a speed workout,
intervals
, or a super long run unless you're training specifically for some kind of endurance event that requires you to wear a pack,” she says. She also wouldn’t do it for recovery runs. The best time to wear your vest is on a shorter to medium-range
easy run
.

How To Choose A Weighted Vest Suitable For Running
There are two main things you want to focus on when picking a weighted vest: fit and load. When it comes to fit, you’re going to want to make sure your vest is snug enough so that it doesn’t do a lot of moving around—but loose enough so that you can fully expand your chest to get a deep breath in, says Dr. Chien. Vests with plenty of adjustable straps are one way to make sure you can get a good fit.
Meanwhile, when it comes to weight, you don’t want to go too heavy, says Dr. Chien. Not only can it affect your form, but it could lead to injury. Stick to a weight of 5 to 10 percent of your own body mass, Glatt recommends. (So, if you are 150 pounds, shop for a vest that is anywhere from 7 to 10 pounds.) Loads heavier than 10 percent of your body weight increase the risk of tibial loading and stress injuries, according to
a 2023 study
. You can always start with less weight and then add more over time. Plus, you’ll also want to make sure that the vest distributes its weight evenly, adds Glatt.
Choose a weighted vest that is 5 to 10 percent of your body weight and adjustable to fit it comfortably to your body.
The 3 Best Weighted Vests For Running
Henkelion Weighted Vest
Now 15% Off
$35
$30 at Amazon
This Amazon find comes in weights ranging from four to 20 pounds. It's Coviello's rec for its even weight distribution and price point. Plus, it has a mesh pocket for you to add additional weight—or carry supplies on your run. (It was also awarded
WH
's best weighted vest for running
.)
ZELUS Weighted Vest
$34 at Amazon
In addition to coming in fun colors, the ZELUS weighted vest is breathable, soft, and adjustable.
WH
voted it the best bounce-free weighted vest, which is exactly what you want if you're going to take it on a run.
RitFit Weighted Vest
$44 at Amazon
$101 at kateminimalist.com
This vest has a lot of adjustable straps, mesh pockets, and even weight distribution across your upper body. It might be particularly a good fit for people with larger chests because of where the straps are placed.
Who Shouldn’t Wear A Weighted Vest
Weighted vests aren’t for everyone. If you’ve never done
strength training
before, it’s best to
start by lifting weights in the gym
rather than adding weight to your runs, says Coviello. Similarly, if you’re new to running, she suggests focusing on form and running without one first.
Plus, if you have lower back issues, joint pain, or are recovering from an injury or surgery, talk to your doctor first to make sure it’s safe to incorporate a weighted vest.

Feeling inspired to work out but not sure what to do? Well, consider your problem solved: The
Women's Health
Workout Finder Tool is here to help you find a routine that fits your goals, equipment preferences, and timeframe in seconds.
How it works: In the interactive window below, select your responses to the following three questions.
What type of workout do you want to do today?
How much time do you have?
Do you want to use equipment?
Next, you'll be prompted with personalized options from the
WH
workout database that check *all* the boxes you were looking for. Hit "Get Started" beneath your winning choice, and the workout will open in a new browser window.
Then, you're ready to sweat. It's that easy!
Should you prioritize cardio or strength training workouts?
The
WH
workout database features hundreds of workouts that are either strength-focused, cardio-focused, or a blend of both. The type you choose ultimately depends on your personal goals.
For example, if you are looking to build muscle and improve overall strength,
trainers generally recommend
prioritizing resistance training (and doing it
before
you get your cardio in so you have the energy to lift heavy). On the other hand, if you're working on endurance or training for, say, a 5K, lean into cardio workouts first and foremost—then supplement them with strength training. (This
complete guide to cardio versus resistance training
goes even deeper.)

It's easy to fit in to a jam-packed schedule.

Women's Health
During those whirlwind weeks, it’s hard to make time for an effective workout. Here’s a secret: You don’t need a full hour or even 30 minutes to get a good arm workout in. If you have 10 minutes, you can strengthen your
biceps
,
triceps
, and
shoulders
.
This 10-minute dumbbell
arm day workout
proves it. It all comes down to smart moves and equipment. Dumbbells are a great option because the shape allows the weight to be distributed evenly on both sides of the handles. “In the context of this arm workout, you're going to be able to isolate your muscles a little bit easier” than you would with a kettlebell, says
Colette Nguyen
, CPT, an ACE-certified personal trainer and trainer at
Soho Strength Lab
. Plus, dumbbells are easy to hold securely with the balanced weight distribution, so you don't have unwanted movement or energy expended. "Your stable and secure grip will help maximize tension in the arms and shoulders and increase the intensity for this workout," says Nguyen.
What's more, you maximize your time with the order of the moves. This dumbbell arm workout features compound sets, which are “two exercises performed back to back and targeting the same muscle,” Nguyen says. Working in this style minimizes rest breaks and ups the burn on the muscles—biceps, triceps, rear delts, and shoulders.
Meet the expert:
Colette Nguyen
, CPT, is an ACE-certified personal trainer and trainer at
Soho Strength Lab
.
Finally, you’re probably wondering…how heavy should my
dumbbells
be? Start with a
lighter set of weights
, and you’ll know within the first 30 seconds of the workout whether they’re too heavy or not, she says. “If you feel like you can do all 30 seconds with a moderate amount of fatigue, that would be appropriate,” she says.
Ready to get into it? Time to tone and strengthen your arms fast.
10-Minute Dumbbell Arm Day Workout
Time:
10 minutes |
Equipment:
light to medium dumbbells |
Good for:
biceps, triceps, shoulders
Instructions:
This workout includes three supersets (pairs of exercises) and one finisher. Do as many reps as possible (AMRAP) for 30 seconds, then take 15 seconds of rest, alternating the two moves. Repeat that two times, then move on to the next superset. For the finisher, do AMRAP for 60 seconds.

2
Zottman Curl
Muscle targeted:
biceps and forearms
Why it's effective:
"This bicep curl variation helps develop forearm and
grip strength
, which is great for those who work with their hands regularly," she says. For example, those who work desk jobs, cook, do mountain climbers, or work as nail techs all benefit.
How to:
Start by standing upright with feet hip-width apart, holding dumbbells with arms are down by sides with palms facing thighs.
Curl both dumbbells up toward the shoulders, with palms up.
At the top, rotate the dumbbells until palms face forward.
Then, lower arms back down to thighs and with palms facing down.
At the bottom, rotate dumbbells until palms face forward again.
That's 1 rep.
Trainer tip: "
Keep a firm grip and neutral wrists as you perform this exercise," Nguyen says.

3
Hammer Curl
Muscles targeted
:
biceps
Why it's effective:
This is an easier grip, Nguyen says, so you can increase the reps and strengthen the biceps.
How to:
Start by standing upright with feet hip-width apart, holding dumbbells with arms at sides and palms facing the midline.
Curl arms up toward the shoulders, keeping palms facing the midline and upper arms still.
Lower arms back down to sides to return to the starting position.
That's 1 rep.
Trainer tip:
"Keep the elbows slightly forward of the torso for the entire duration of the exercise," Nguyen says.
4
Bent-Over Swimmer Row
Muscles worked:
rear delts, upper back, and triceps
Why it's effective:
This move is a good ways to practice the bent-over position, prepping for the triceps exercise on deck.
How to:
Stand with feet hip-width apart and a gentle bend in knees, holding dumbbells with palms facing in.
Fold over at hips so that torso is nearly parallel to the floor, letting arms hang naturally toward the floor with palms facing toward the midline.
Keeping elbows extended, raise dumbbells up above torso without using any momentum and keeping arms a comfortable distance from sides of body (not too narrow and not too wide).
With straight arms, lower dumbbells back down toward the floor to return to the starting position.
That's 1 rep.
Trainer tip:
"It’s important to perform this exercise with no momentum," Nguyen says. "Pause at the top for an extra push."

5
Bent-Over Triceps Kickback
Muscles worked:
triceps
Why it's effective:
"This is a functional training move that targets the triceps while also challenging your postural endurance and stability in a bent over position," she says.
How
to:
Stand with feet hip-width apart and a gentle bend in knees, holding dumbbells. Fold over at hips so that torso is nearly parallel to the floor.
Row upper arms up in line with torso with palms facing toward the midline.
Maintaining the position, extended elbows until fully locked out.
Reverse the motion to return to the starting position.
That's 1 rep.
Trainer tip:
Locking out the elbows at the top ensures you hit the full range of motion and contract the triceps.
6
Eccentric Triceps Pushup
Muscles worked:
triceps, abs, and pecs
Why it's effective:
"Focusing on the eccentric portion of the movement (the lowering phase) helps develop control, stability, and strength of the triceps," Nguyen says. It's also a great way to improve your
pushups
.
How to:
Start in a high plank (option to start on knees) with hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart holding dumbbells on the ground and the legs hip-width apart.
Slowly lower body to the mat in a straight line. Ideally, elbows will be behind/above torso.
Casually reset in the high plank starting position.
That's 1 rep.
Trainer tip:
"This is all about lowering, so there's no actual push up," says Nguyen. You want to focus on lowering the torso down slowly and with control.

7
Skull Crusher
Muscles worked:
triceps
Why it's effective:
"This exercise stabilizes the body and isolates the triceps so you can focus on a high volume of reps," Nguyen says.
How to:
Start by laying on back with knees bent and feet flat on the floor.
Hold dumbbells in hands and extend arms straight and lengthened toward the ceiling, shoulder-width apart, and slightly deviated overhead (the crease of the elbows will be in direct line of sight) with palms facing toward the midline.
Keeping upper arms still, bend elbows and lower dumbbells until they hover close to the top of head.
Straighten the elbows to return back to the starting position.
That's 1 rep.
Trainer tip:
Imagine you're putting sunglasses on top of your head when lowering the dumbbells.
8
Lateral Raise
Muscles worked:
delts, mid/upper trap, and triceps
Why it's effective:
"This lateral raise variation challenges
shoulder mobility
and stability through a full range of motion, including overhead," Nguyen says.
How to:
Start kneeling with knees under hips and arms down by sides with palms facing forward holding dumbbells. (Option to stand upright with feet hip-width apart.)
Allowing a gentle bend in elbows, lift arms out to sides and up overhead (as if you are tracing a big circle from thighs to above head). Keep palms facing forward throughout.
Slowly reverse the motion to lower arms to sides.
That's 1 rep.
Trainer tip:
It's okay to use speed to help launch the dumbbells overhead. Focus more on controlling the lowering back down.

How To Do A Chest Fly Correctly Using Dumbbells
How To Do A Chest Fly Correctly Using Dumbbells
Bottles of water or canned goods work too.

There are so many different
dumbbell exercises
you can use to strengthen and sculpt your upper body. One in particular that I encourage my clients to do if they want to
tone their shoulders
, chest, and arms is the chest fly.
Why? It's incredibly effective at isolating these muscles groups because you're lying on your back. Being in a supine position offers more stability and the opportunity to really put the work into the places you're targeting, hence why the chest fly is so, well, fly.
While your lower body gets a break, you will need to keep your core engaged by drawing your navel toward your spine and bracing your abs in an isometric hold. Maintaining a contraction in your core while you work your arms will help strengthen your midsection at the same time that you're building muscle in your arms. It also ensures that you don't put stress on your lower back while doing this exercise.
What's more, this move doesn't require a ton of equipment to perform. Two dumbbells are all you need. But it can also be done with two full water bottles or canned goods if you don't have any free weights at home.
As an ACE certified trainer, I'll break down how to do a lying dumbbell chest fly with step-by-step instructions below, plus go into its benefits, offer some variations, and a few pro tips to fine tune your technique. Let's get started.
How To Do A Dumbbell Chest Fly
Start by lying on your back with your feet placed flat on the floor. Grasp the dumbbells with your palms facing inward.
Push the dumbbells directly above your chest with lightly bent elbows, keeping your wrists straight.
Inhale and slowly lower the dumbbells toward the floor at shoulder height, maintaining a soft roundness with your arms (think: hugging a tree). Stop when the backs of your upper arms touch the mat.
Exhale and slowly raise the dumbbells back to the starting position while maintaining the arc in your arms.
Form Tips:
People tend to go through the movement too fast. So make sure to take your time, keep your core engaged, bra line pushed into the floor, and don't overarch your lower back.
Reps/sets for best results:
I suggest using medium sized dumbbells and doing 10–15 reps three times through.
What Are The Benefits Of A Dumbbell Chest Fly?
Of course, the dumbbell chest fly will target your chest and shoulders, but it can also help improve you posture as it opens up the upper body and helps with scapular retraction (translation: the pulling of one's shoulder blades towards the spine).
I am currently seven months pregnant and complete this move in all of my
upper body strength workouts
to keep my posture upright while I gain more weight in my baby bump.
Runners also tend to love this move for its posture-improving benefits too. Better overall posture means better form and more efficient runs.
Variations Of The Dumbbell Chest Fly
Do them standing up:
Grab two dumbbells
, holding one in each hand with palms facing towards each other, arms by your sides. Stand with your feet hip-width apart, hinging at your hips with soft knees and a neutral spine at a 45 degree angle. While keeping a slight bend in your elbows you will lift dumbbells up and out to your sides until they reach shoulder height. Hold at the top, squeezing shoulder blades together, then slowly lower back to starting position. This will help you improve your posture even more by challenging and strengthening those posterior muscles on the backside of your body.
Try it using a stability ball:
Lie on a
stability ball
with your shoulder blades on top of the ball and the rest of your body in a table top position (knees over ankles, legs bent at 90 degrees, and feet flat on the floor). Lift your arms over your chest as you would in a regular lying chest fly. This is
great for core strength
and balance and will force you to focus on form while trying to remain stable on the ball.
Alternate your arms:
Everything will be exactly the same as a complete lying chest fly, but this time you're going to alternate between lowering one arm at a time. This will present an extra core challenge because you'll have to work harder to engage your core in order to not let your torso rotate from side to side with the weights.
How To Add The Dumbbell Chest Fly To Your Routine
You will want to give your muscles time to recover, so performing chest flyes two or three times a week is enough. Here's how to add it to your routine.
Add them to your upper body strength day
: If you're focusing mainly on arms and shoulders, throw in the chest fly. It will challenge your upper body stability, improve posture, and tone those upper chest muscles too.
Work it into a chest or shoulder focused routine:
This is a pretty self-explanatory recommendation, but the chest fly is the perfect move to add to your chest or shoulder routine. Say you just got finished doing a
shoulder press
, throw in a chest fly afterwards for another upper-body challenge.

How To Do A Reverse Fly The Right Way
How To Do A Reverse Fly The Right Way
Squeeze those shoulder blades.

You know in
The Notebook
when Rachel McAdams runs along the beach saying she's a bird while flapping her arms? Yeah, that's kind of how it feels whenever you do a reverse fly exercise. But this move is so much more than an homage to the classic rom, it's a fantastic way to tone and strengthen your back. Specifically, "reverse flys work the muscles on the back of the shoulders called deltoids," says celebrity fitness trainer and "Revenge Body" star
Lacey Stone
. "They also work the upper and middle back, mainly the rhomboids and traps."
But to really reap the benefits of this upper body move, you need to do it correctly.
How To Do A Reverse Fly
How to:
Grab a pair of dumbbells and stand with your feet hip-width apart and your knees slightly bent. Hinge forward at the hips and let your arms hang straight down from your shoulders, palms facing your body. Raise both arms out to the sides as you squeeze your shoulder blades together. Return to start. That's one rep.
Sets/reps for results:
12 reps for 3 sets
Reverse flys strengthen your back, and may improve posture.
Form tips:
"When you’re lifting the dumbbells, you should be focused on squeezing your shoulder blades together," says Stone. "Also, be sure to keep your chest open to the ground which will ensure you use you upper back and deltoids to lift the dumbbells." It's also important to think about your arms: "Lead with your arms, make sure your elbows are slightly bent, and don’t go past shoulder height when you lift the dumbbells," she says.  And don't forget about those abs! Keep them engaged so you don't put too much pressure on your lower back or neck.
Benefits Of Reverse Fly
As mentioned, reverse flys are primo for toning your upper back and the backs of your shoulders. Why is that important? For starters, it will help improve your posture, says Stone. So if you sit at your desk all day long slouched over a computer, you may want to add reverse flys to your arsenal, stat.

Doing this exercise can also help you reduce the risk of shoulder injury, since you're building up supporting muscles. Plus, it can help reduce neck and shoulder pain.
Try this complete upper body workout that helped one woman majorly transform her arms:
Make Reverse Fly Part Of Your Workout
Due to their awesome back and shoulder benefits, Stone recommends adding this exercise to your routine at least once a week. It fits seamlessly into an
upper-body
day, or
back-specific workout
.
You can also try different variations—like alternating, which will help up the challenge for your core muscles.
However you decide to add reverse flys into your routine, get ready for a stronger upper back and better posture in your future. Boom!

Master The Military Press For For Sexy, Strong Shoulders
Master The Military Press For For Sexy, Strong Shoulders
It's a sculpting secret weapon.
By Rachel Straub and CSCS

Why Trust Us?
Like making espresso or riding a bike, some actions that look simple, can actually be deceptively challenging. And that goes for the military press—that move where you press weights from your shoulders over your head.
While this exercise is great for sculpting  muscles,  if you don’t nail the basic form, this simple movement can tear up your shoulders, says Rachel Straub, CSCS, a Los Angeles-based exercise physiologist and author of
Weight Training Without Injury
.
Get it right, though, and you have a secret weapon for sexy, strong shoulders.
How To Do A Military Press
How to:
Begin in a seated or standing position with your neck long and arms in a cactus shape (open to your sides with elbows bent at 90 degrees and pointed toward floor). Brace core and lift hands straight up above head, arms fully extended and palms facing forward. Lower back to the starting position, ensuring your hands don’t go lower than your shoulders and that you squeeze your scapulae (i.e. shoulder blades) together and down your back at the bottom of every rep.
Reps/sets for best results:
Generally, aim for three sets of 8 to 12 reps. If the last 3 reps of any set aren’t challenging, increase your weights or reps (max 20), Straub says.
Military presses primarily work your shoulders, but they also target your triceps.
Form tips:
If you want to add weight, hold dumbbells or a barbell in the same position. Just make sure everything stays in front of your face or you risk irreparable damage to your rotator cuff and neck, Straub says. The weight at the top of the move and your elbows on the way down should both never move behind your head (this is most common with a barbell or a machine).
Benefits Of Military Press
Military presses are primarily a shoulder exercise, though they also work the other muscles in your arms, like the
triceps
. You *can* do it while standing on an uneven surface to incorporate balance, or as part of a circuit for more cardio, but generally the military press is a move strictly for
strength
, Straub explains.
More Exercises

How To Do A Single-Leg Deadlift
There are endless
shoulder exercises
to choose from, but because the military press uses a major functional movement (pressing) from an advantageous point of leverage (at the shoulders), this allows you to lift more weight than other shoulder moves, like raises.
But be careful—even though it’s a very basic move, people often do it wrong, which, when combined with weight, ups your risk for injury. Also, doing it too often can lead to shoulder problems, like tearing your rotator cuff. And you should skip it entirely if you have shoulder issues, Straub advises.
Make Military Presses Part Of Your Workout
Military presses shouldn’t be your go-to shoulder move—you need strength in the major muscles to safely hold a weight above your head without risking your rotator cuff health, Straub says. And skip it during a
full-body workout
—you’re better off hitting the larger muscle groups like chest and back.
But it does make for a great addition to a regular
upper-body routine
.
The military press is ideal as part of a
superset
or
HIIT workout
, alongside
chest exercises
like flies and presses,
back exercises
like rows and reverse flies, and
arm exercises
like tricep extensions and bicep curls.
For a complete upper-body workout, check out this routine:
Beginners should start without weights, then once your biomechanics are nailed down, progress to doing it with dumbbells, a barbell, or resistance bands. Sitting keeps you more stable, but for more of a challenge, Straub suggests trying the press while standing. No, sweat!

How To Do A Renegade Row Like A Total Fitness Beast
How To Do A Renegade Row Like A Total Fitness Beast
This one is a double-whammy that works your arms AND core.

Irish coffee, workout dresses, cast-iron skillets—who doesn't love a good two-for-one? Renegade rows are a mash-up of two of the best upper body builders:
planks
and
dumbbell
rows. But don’t be fooled by all the arm-talk—this move requires a crazy amount of core strength to keep your body stable, says Harris Murrieta, CSCS, coach for personal training platform
Ladder
and director of recovery at Performix House in New York City.
It also requires you to stop making one common mistake: Twisting your hips. Here's the trick to mastering the move and getting the most out of this two-for-one exercise.
How To Do A
Renegade Row
How to:
Place two dumbbells on the floor shoulder width apart. Assume a plank position with your feet wider than shoulder-distance apart. Grasp the dumbbells so your hands are elevated off the floor, maintaining a neutral wrist position. Drive your right arm through the dumbbell into the floor, stiffen your entire body, and row the left dumbbell up and to the side of your rib cage—your elbow should be pointed up and back. Keep your body stable as you slowly lower the dumbbell back to the floor. Then repeat on the other side. That’s one rep.
Renegade rows strengthen your arms, shoulders, back, and core.
Reps/sets for best results:
Complete 15 reps on each side. Or, complete 50 seconds of continuous reps, followed by 10 seconds of rest.
Form tips:
Taking too narrow of a stance will make stability almost impossible, Murrieta says. But if your feet are the width of a yoga mat and you still can’t keep your spine straight during the plank and row, work on building your foundational core strength before you attempt this move—or you risk injury, she cautions.
Benefits Of
Renegade Rows
The renegade row combines the benefits of a plank and traditional dumbbell row, meaning it targets your core, shoulders, and upper back. It’s also an anti-rotational
core exercise
—because you’re trying
not
to twist. The resistance actually works your
obliques
, as well as that super-hard-to-reach deep core, Murrieta explains.
Since so many muscles are involved, this move can also build strength without a super-heavy weight (read: great if you have limited equipment during an at-home workout).
Want to try a complete upper-body workout? Check out a full routine below:
Make
Renegade Rows Part Of
Your Workout
Because the renegade row is a tough movement, incorporate it early in the workout while your body is still fresh, Murrieta advises.
It’s a great addition to an upper-body strength workout and, since it utilizes so many muscles, it pairs well with isolation exercises like
tricep extensions
,
bicep curls
, and shoulder raises.
If it’s too hard, go for your standard pushup modifications: Drop to your knees. Murrieta says taking your lower-body weight out of the equation helps reduce the ask on your arms and core.

How To Find The Right Dumbbell Weight For Your Fitness Goals, According To A Personal Trainer
How To Find The Right Dumbbell Weight For Your Fitness Goals, According To A Personal Trainer
Found: Your fool-proof guide to greater gains.

Picking
the right weight dumbbells
is like shopping for clothing: You won’t know what works for you until you actually try it (on). It’d be great if there was some magic equation that would calculate exactly what weights will feel light, medium, and heavy for you during different workouts. But unfortunately, it’s not so predictable, because lots of variables affect how much you can lift.
Dumbbell weight is “never going to be one-size-fits-all,” says Nellie Barnett, CPT, the author of
The Woman’s Guide to Strength Training: Dumbbells
, founder of
Nellbells Fitness
, and an alum of the
Women’s Health
Strength in Diversity class of 2023
.
(FYI: This book features a 12-week strength training program,
free for new WH+ Premium All Access Members
!) The amount you lift is based on your individual physical fitness level, goals (like
muscle hypertrophy
versus endurance), and the body part you’re working.
So, rather than seeking out a specific number, focus on finding your Goldilocks of dumbbells—not too light, not too heavy. If the weight is too light, you won’t challenge your muscles or see results. And if it’s too heavy? You’re more prone to injuring yourself. That ~just right~ weight will help you achieve “what your body is capable of lifting while maintaining proper form,” Barnett says.
Considering
Barnett wrote the book on dumbbells
(literally!), she knows better than anyone what to consider before picking up a pair. Ahead, she explains how to find the right weight dumbbells for you and shares guidance on when to level up what you’re lifting:
Think about your fitness goals.
Lifting dumbbells is so much more than just picking up and putting down weights—you can achieve real strength goals over time by tweaking different variables, like weight, reps, and sets, Barnett says. Here are some guidelines to follow for different strength training goals.
If you want to…
Sculpt muscle:
Lift medium to heavy weights for six to 12 reps and three to six sets.
Build stamina:
Lift light weights for 12 or more reps and three sets.
Lift heavy objects:
Lift heavy weights for six or less reps and three to five sets.
Lift heavy objects quickly:
Lift heavy weights for one to two reps and three to five sets.

.
Consider the specific exercise.
There’s a reason you can squat
way
more than you can curl. That’s because smaller muscles like your biceps, shoulders, and core are physically unable to lift as much as larger muscles like your back, chest, and legs. These latter muscles “can handle heavier weight because they're designed to generate more power,” Barnett says.
That’s why it’s always good to have multiple sets of dumbbells by your side while you’re working out.
Use the light-to-medium set for these smaller muscle groups:
Biceps
Triceps
Shoulders
Core
Use the medium-to-heavy set for these larger muscle groups:
Back
Chest
Legs

Perform a rep test.
With your fitness goal and muscle group in mind, grab a lighter weight than you think you can handle (so you don’t risk injury) and try to reach the rep count for each exercise. If your goal is building muscle stamina in your arms, for example, and you think you can handle lifting five-pound dumbbells for a minimum of 12 reps, you should conduct a rep test by lifting three-pound dumbbells for those 12 reps.
When you finish the rep test—even if you had to put your weight down before completing all the desired reps—ask yourself these questions:
Am I maintaining proper form throughout all of my reps?
Am I breathing properly and not holding my breath?
Am I completing my reps, especially in my first set?
If the answer to any of these is “no,”
decrease
your weight.
But if you said “yes” to those questions, then ask yourself these questions:
Am I feeling particularly challenged on the last two or three reps?
Am I performing each rep with control, or am I just breezing through them all?
Am I actively thinking about the muscles that I’m engaging (a.k.a., the mind-muscle connection)?
If the answer to any of these is “no,”
increase
your weight.
When should I start increasing my dumbbell weight?
Once you've begun your strength training journey, the main way to get stronger over time is with progressive overload. Essentially, this means increasing at least one variable in your workout (weight, reps, or sets) to ensure you’re consistently challenging your body, Barnett says. So, if you’ve been lifting five-pound dumbbells for a month or two, and you’re finding that all of the reps feel easy—not just those last two or three—it’s likely time to increase your weight by a few pounds.

Remember: No matter what dumbbell weight you choose, with each workout, you're one rep closer to becoming stronger!

Why Trust Us?
Let’s be real—
running
indoors can sometimes feel repetitive, boring, and frankly, like the least appealing thing to do when at the gym. But as the temps continue to drop this season, the best thing about
treadmill
workouts is that there are plenty—and I mean
endless
—ways to switch it up.
Crank up the speed and go all-out for some
sprints
, mess with the incline to power through hill climbs, or get bold and throw in
walking lunges
to create a spicy
HIIT
session. These seven
treadmill
workouts from top trainers will shake up your routine—and who knows, you might even (dare I say it?) start looking forward to hopping on this mainstay machine.
Oh, and if you’re thinking about upgrading your
home gym setup
, check out our favorite treadmills to help you stay cozy
and
fit this season.

1. THE BEST TREADMILL WORKOUT FOR STRENGTH
What it’s all about:
Keep your treadmill at a 1 percent incline whenever you reach your
steady-state
pace—this is your recovery period. You’ll increase the
incline
from there to target your
glutes
and
hamstrings
. “By increasing the incline, you will increase the effort it takes to maintain your speed,” says Latham, the creator of this workout.
Time:
15+ minutes
5 minutes:
Warm-up (
walk
or jog)
1 minute:
Steady-state pace at 1 percent incline
1 minute:
Maintain pace at 2 percent incline
1 minute:
Maintain pace at 1 percent incline
1 minute:
Maintain pace at 3 percent incline
Continue alternating 1 minute at 1 percent incline, then 1 minute at a higher incline
, increasing by 1 percent incline every time, until you have reached the highest incline on the treadmill (or as high as you can go). Maintain steady-state pace throughout.
5 minutes:
Cooldown (walk or jog)

2. THE BEST TREADMILL WORKOUT FOR ENDURANCE
What it’s all about:
Push your steady pace—that speed you can comfortably maintain for about a half hour—through longer and longer intervals in this workout from Latham. You’ll increase your speed for one to three minutes, with an
active recovery
after that. “The longer you increase speed, the longer your steady-state pace,” says Latham. Breathe deep and focus on running long and strong.
Time:
17+ minutes
5 minutes:
Warm-up (walk or jog)
1 minute:
1–2 mph above steady-state pace
1 minute:
Steady-state pace
2 minutes:
1–2 mph above steady-state pace
2 minutes:
Steady-state pace
3 minutes:
1–2 mph above steady-state pace
3 minutes:
Steady-state pace
Repeat until fatigued
, always matching your steady-state pace recovery with the duration of your effort.
5 minutes:
Cooldown (walk or jog)
3. THE BEST TREADMILL WORKOUT FOR WEIGHT LOSS
What it’s all about:
Targeting your glutes, hamstrings,
quads
, and
calves
with this treadmill workout that also incorporates
strength training moves
, created by Ragaas. Bonus: It will help improve your
core stability
—a key to better, faster mileage.
Time:
13-16 minutes
4 minutes:

4. THE BEST TREADMILL WORKOUT FOR POWER
What it’s all about:
This workout centers around 60-second sprints. To figure out your sprint speed, consider your steady-state pace—a pace you can maintain for about 25 to 30 minutes—says Ellen Latham, CPT, creator and co-founder of Orangetheory Fitness. Then, increase that speed by two miles per hour for your spring pace. “The goal is to try to match or slightly increase the speed from the previous effort [with each sprint],” she says. “The purpose of this style of
interval training
is to increase your muscles' ability to produce power on the treadmill.” You’ll also improve the rate at which you recover from each sprint, as well as your endurance.
Time:
16-20 minutes
5 minutes:
Warm-up (walk or jog)
1 minute:
Steady-state pace
1 minute:
Sprint
Repeat the minute intervals
6-10 times, alternating steady-state pace and sprint
5 minutes:
Cooldown (walk or jog)
5. THE BEST
TREADMILL
WORKOUT FOR BEGINNERS
What it’s all about:
Beginner runners
tend to gravitate toward running workouts with a lot of room for breaks, says Karli Alvino, CPT, a personal trainer and coach at Mile High Run Club. “This program has a lot of intervals, as well as room for improvement.” Because of this, it's a good intro to tread workouts. FYI: RPE stands for "rate of perceived exertion.”On a scale of 0 to 10, think of 0 as an effort equivalent to relaxing on the couch, 5 a recovery jog that’s easy enough for you to talk, and 10 your all-out sprint, says Alvino.
Time:
38 minutes
5 minutes:
Warm-up (
dynamic stretches
, walk or jog)
90 seconds:
Light run (RPE 6)
1 minute:
Recovery walk (RPE 3–4)
90 seconds:
Run at 3 percent incline (RPE 6–7)
1 minute:
Recovery walk (RPE 3–4)
90 seconds:
Hard run (RPE 8)
1 minute:
Recovery walk (RPE 3–4)
90 seconds:
Hard run (RPE 8–9)

6. THE BEST TREADMILL WORKOUT FOR STAMINA
What it’s all about:
Strengthen your
cardio endurance
and improve your muscular endurance (or how long your muscles can work) with this program. “Muscular endurance allows you to perform a skill more effectively, and you achieve it through developing
muscular strength at lower loads
and high repetition," says Michaela Ragaas, CPT,  personal trainer and education and training manager at Technogym, who designed this incline workout to do just that.

7. THE BEST TREADMILL WORKOUT FOR SPEED
What it’s all about:
“Speed is considered one of the most fundamental components of fitness performance,” says Ragaas. To pick up your pace and build your strength, you’ll focus on both speed and inclines during this workout. Don’t be afraid to get uncomfortable!

This Is The Bare Minimum Amount Of Cardio You Need To Do Every Week To See Results
This Is The Bare Minimum Amount Of Cardio You Need To Do Every Week To See Results
Experts explain how much you should be doing, based on your goals.

If your weekly schedule looks like a jigsaw puzzle, squeezing in both
cardio and strength training
can be tough. Instead of making
cardio
feel like yet another looming item on your to-do list, let's break down exactly what counts as cardio and how much time you need to get it done, based on your goals.
The
CDC
recommends at least
150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity cardio
(like brisk walking) or
75 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity
(like
running
) to
promote a healthy heart
and reduce the risk of chronic disease. That could look like just 30 minutes of
walking
five days per week, and yes, the 20 minutes you spent
walking your dog
plus the 10 minutes you spent cruising to and from your car throughout the day totally count.
Here’s the thing, though: While you certainly don’t need hours of running or back-to-back
spin classes
to see real health benefits, these guidelines are designed as broad, catchall recommendations for the
entire
U.S. adult population. They’re a great starting point but not exactly personalized.
If you have specific fitness goals, like improving endurance,
losing weight
, or
building strength
, you might need a more tailored approach to figure out how much cardio—and at what intensity—is right for you.
Below, with the help of Corrine Carnation, CPT, a personal and group fitness trainer, let's figure it out.
Meet the expert:
Corrine Carnation
, CPT, is a personal and group trainer at
Equinox
and the creator of
Better You, Better Living
, a virtual training program.
What counts as cardio?
Not all cardio is created equal—intensity matters. Different levels of cardio intensity require different time commitments to achieve the health and fitness benefits you’re after, so it’s important to tailor your workouts based on your personal goals, says Carnation.
For many people, a combination of moderate and vigorous cardio throughout the week works best. This approach can help keep workouts interesting, accommodate fluctuating energy levels, and balance meeting goals with the time constraints of a busy schedule. Carnation suggests experimenting with different intensities to find what you enjoy most while staying consistent.
Before you dive into a new cardio routine, figure out your
resting heart rate
(RHR), says Carnation. For most people, it’s somewhere between 60 and 100 beats per minute (BPM). Your RHR is personal—it’s influenced by things like your age, how active you are, and even your overall health—and gives you a baseline to track how your fitness improves over time. In general, the more cardiovascularly fit you are, the lower your RHR—
elite endurance athletes
can have resting heart rates as low as 35 BPM.
How to find your resting heart rate:
Using your index and middle finger, find your pulse (at your wrist or neck). Count the number of beats in 15 seconds, then multiply that number by four,
according to the Mayo Clinic
.
If you’ve got a wearable device, like a smartwatch or
fitness tracker
, use it to track your cardio! It’s an easy way to keep tabs on your heart rate and make sure you’re staying in the right zone to make the most of your workouts without second-guessing yourself, says Carnation.
Moderate-Intensity Cardio
This is the most common level of cardio exercise, which involves working hard enough to noticeably quicken your heart rate and breathing but not so hard that you can’t carry on a conversation, according to the
American Heart Association
(AHA). Aim for at least
150 minutes per week of
moderate cardio
, which can be broken down into 30-minute sessions, five days a week, according to the CDC.
It should feel like about five out of 10 on a scale of exertion, with one being rest and 10 being maximum effort, says Carnation. Some examples include walking your dog, casual bike riding or dancing, and recreational
tennis
.
During moderate-intensity cardio, your heart rate will typically fall between 60 to 70 percent of your maximum heart rate (MHR), according to the
National Strength and Conditioning Association
. This might feel like a
brisk walk
for one person or a light jog for someone who is more accustomed to cardio exercise.
How to find your maximum heart rate
:
220 - your age = MHR. For example: if you’re 35 years old, your MHR is 185 BPM (220-35), and 60 to 70 percent of that is 111 to 130 BPM.
Vigorous-Intensity Cardio
Vigorous-intensity cardio, as the name suggests, requires a bit more effort. On the same one-to-10 exertion scale, aim for a seven or above. “This type of cardio is perfect for days when you’re short on time but high on energy,” says Carnation. Think
sprint intervals
,
HIIT workouts
, or cycling at a fast pace. Because of the higher intensity, you only need
75 minutes per week of vigorous cardio
to achieve the same benefits as 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise, according to the CDC.
For vigorous cardio, your heart rate should fall between 80 to 90 percent of your MHR, according to the AHA. Using the earlier example of a 35-year-old, this translates to a target heart rate of 148 to 166 BPM.
The Bare Minimum Cardio You Need
By now it should be clear that the amount of cardio you need to achieve specific health and fitness outcomes varies by age, activity level, and other health factors. However, one thing's for certain: everyone should be doing some amount of
regular cardio
to maintain overall health.
Keep in mind the following:
Cardio sessions should be spread out throughout the week. Don’t do it all at once!
Even short bursts of activity (10 minutes or more) count—every minute counts.
Cardio exercise is just one component of a well-rounded fitness routine. Strength training is also recommended at least two days per week.
Here are some general guidelines to follow, based on a few common goals:
Cardio For Beginners
For some—like those who live in big cities and commute to work—30 minutes of brisk walking a day can feel like nothing. For others, it can be a lot.
If you're starting from ground zero (a.k.a. you don't have an existing, consistent cardio routine), Carnation recommends aiming for
20 minutes of moderate-intensity
cardio a day, four days per week.
“Get moving with something simple like walking your dog around the block or dancing while cooking, just get your body used to moving regularly,” she says. As the routine starts to feel easier, work towards increasing to
30 minutes of cardio per day, five days per week
.
That can look like walking,
swimming
, or cycling for 20 to 30 minutes at a time, or you can break it up in shorter intervals spread throughout your day—whatever works for your schedule and preferences! (More on what moderate-intensity cardio looks like in a sec.) "This is enough to boost your cardiovascular health and build stamina without overwhelming your schedule," says Carnation.

What Is The Run/Walk Method?
Cardio To Maintain Fitness
To keep up your current level of cardiovascular fitness, the CDC's recommendation of
150 minutes of moderate-intensity cardio or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity cardio weekly
can work. While this shouldn't be the
only
physical activity you're doing throughout the week, this guideline is suitable for those who are feeling satisfied with their current fitness level and simply want to maintain where they're at.
If you’re short on time, this can even look like 15 to 25 minute sessions of higher-intensity cardio (like a fast-paced run), three to five days per week. "For those who are in a
maintenance phase
, it's best to try to make being active a regular part of your life, so you don’t even have to think about how many minutes you’re doing," says Carnation.
Cardio For Improved Endurance
For greater health benefits, the CDC recommends increasing to
300 minutes of moderate cardio
or
150 minutes of vigorous cardio
each week.
If your goal is to boost endurance or prepare for an event (like a
race or fitness competition
), Carnation recommends
40 to 60 minutes of moderate-intensity cardio, five days a week
. This doesn’t have to be done all at once—you can break it into smaller chunks throughout the day, like two 20-minute sessions or three 15-minute walks. “Gradually increase the length of your sessions and consider adding one long cardio session, like 60 to 90 minutes, to really build stamina.” In the case that you’re training for something specific, such as a 5k,
half-marathon
, or more, consider a weekly training plan or coach to help you ramp things up.

Cardio For Weight Loss
If
losing weight
is a priority for your health, make sure you have a
nutrition
and
strength training program
in place, and that you consult your doctor on your goals and plan. Losing weight requires a gradual, comprehensive approach to achieve safe and sustainable results, and while cardio can be one component of that journey, it's just one small piece of the puzzle.
That said, to support weight loss, aim for
50 to 60 minutes of a mix of cardio and strength training per day, at least five days per week
, starting with a realistic and manageable routine, says Carnation. Instead of focusing on the length of your workouts, aim for 20 to 30 minutes of cardio most days, combining low- and high-intensity activities. "Pair this with two to three strength training sessions per week and a solid nutrition plan to crush your goals," says Carnation.
If you’re short on time, try breaking this up into smaller chunks, like a brisk 10-minute walk in the morning and a
quick HIIT session
or bike ride later in the day. Every little bit adds up and contributes to your progress—small, sustainable steps will set you up for long-term success without feeling overwhelming.
The Best Ways To Fit More Cardio Into Your Routine
Before you start overthinking it, know that cardio can come in many forms—the most basic of which is simply walking (you can even throw on a
weighted vest
to up the ante). It doesn’t have to involve a ton of time or fancy equipment. (Although there is plenty of great equipment to help you clock those cardio minutes if you’re looking for inspiration.) In fact, sneaking cardio into your day in smaller, manageable ways—like taking the stairs, walking while on a phone call, or choosing a further parking spot—can make it feel less daunting.
It also doesn’t have to feel super intense. While vigorous-intensity exercises like sprint intervals and HIIT workouts elevate your heart rate faster and higher, moderate-intensity cardio workouts have plenty of benefits too, says Carnation. Remember: Something is always better than nothing, and tailoring your routine to what feels good for
your
body is what matters most.
Not sure where to start? Check out the
Women’s Health
Workout Finder Tool
to lock down a routine that fits your goals, equipment preferences, and timeframe.
Here are some common forms of cardio exercises that vary in intensity:
Brisk walking (add a
weighted vest
for an extra challenge)
Running/sprints/jogging
Cycling
Swimming
Stair climbing
Dancing
Rowing
HIIT workouts
Dance (Zumba/aerobics)
Jumping rope
Need a starting point? Try these three quick and effective cardio challenges from Carnation:
Stair climber
: Start at level five and increase by one level every five minutes. You’ll be dripping in sweat in no time, and every step works your lower-body muscles like no other, meaning you'll also get strengthening benefits.
Treadmill challenge
: Start running at a one percent incline, then increase the incline by one percent every minute until you hit 15 percent. By the end, you’ll be walking and soaked in sweat!
Air bike
: Start with a 30-second all-out sprint followed by 30 seconds of slow, steady pedaling to recover. Repeat this cycle for at least 5 minutes. It’s brutal, but effective.
Bottom line
: Anything that elevates your heart rate above resting for the duration of activity qualifies as cardio, so you can pick and choose your favorite way to move and even mix it up in a single session if you prefer variety! By focusing on the minimum duration and intensity needed for your goals, and using your own heart rate as a guide, you can integrate cardio into your routine without feeling like it's an all-or-nothing effort. And remember: consistency is key.

Why Trust Us?
When it comes to
running
, slow and steady wins the race. Well, okay, maybe not
wins
the race, but finishes—and finishes strong. Just ask the
self-described “slow runners” on TikTok
, who wear the label like a badge of honor.
Ultimately, “slow” is relative and subjective, but it’s a word that can sometimes be used to discredit runners or box certain people out of the sport, especially if they’re clocking 13-plus minute miles, says Kelly Roberts, a RRCA-certified running coach and founder of the running community Badass Lady Gang.
But here’s the thing: “Slow runners” are lacing up their
sneakers
. They’re putting in the time and building up mileage. And, they’re
finishing marathons
—just like their “faster” peers. There’s a lot everyone can learn from slow running, which is a term Jes Woods, a RRCA-certified Nike Run coach, doesn’t even use. “I feel very strongly about not using the word ‘slow,’” she says. “I like to use ‘easy running’ or ‘low-effort.’” This is because pace isn’t nearly as important as how your run feels and because it changes by the day depending on so many variable factors.
And, BTW, 80 percent of your runs are supposed to feel easy, says Woods. Slowing down your pace and embracing a lower-effort run makes all the difference in
anyone’s
training plan
.
No matter what word you want to use, this is your reminder that it’s okay to slow down. Here’s why.
Meet the experts:
Jes Woods
is an RRCA-certified run coach for
Nike Run
and
Brooklyn Track Club
.
Kelly Roberts
is an RRCA-certified run coach and founder of the running community
Badass Lady Gang
.
What constitutes a “slow run” anyway?
At the end of the day, “slow” is subjective, and the only definition that matters is your own. To some people, it might mean running a certain pace, but this pace is different for everyone. As Woods and Roberts point out, it’s really best to think about how a run
feels
, and better descriptors might be “low-effort” or “easy” for a run that ends up being a slower pace for you.
How can you tell if your run is the right level of effort? Try the talk test, says Woods. Call up a friend or run with a buddy. If you’re able to hold a convo without getting interrupted by heavy breathing, you’re
running
at a low-effort pace for your body. This is what the term “conversational pace” is getting at. You can also pull a
Taylor Swift
and try to sing while running to make sure you’re going at the right pace, adds Roberts. (She usually has her trainees sing “I Wanna Dance With Somebody,” but “You Belong With Me” is a great option too.)

There’s a reason runners also call this pace a “sexy run,” “social run,” or “party pace.” Done right, you should also feel like you can do those kinds of runs forever—but don’t worry, you don’t have to.
Why Slower Run Paces Have Major Payoffs
There are a lot of benefits of slow running, so much so that 80 percent of your runs should be at that easier, low-effort pace, while the other 20 percent can be more challenging like speed runs, hills, or tempo runs.
“You are physiologically becoming a more efficient runner,” Woods says. “At these lower intensities, you're building your aerobic base, which is mission-critical for any athlete.” If you want to run a race, no matter the distance, you need that
aerobic base
. It’s all about teaching your body to use oxygen well, says Roberts. Running at a conversational pace builds up mitochondrial density, myoglobin content, and capillary development. All of these things contribute to your body using oxygen effectively and efficiently, which is what makes you a better runner.
It also gives you time to
recover
. “If running is always really hard, it's hard to stick with it because you're kind of feeling constantly beat up and you're putting yourself at risk for injury,” says Roberts. Running fast breaks down your body, so you need to make sure you’ve got recovery—a.k.a. slow—runs baked into your week.

Easy runs are also more sustainable. If you’re always ending a run feeling completely drained and exhausted, by slowing down you might find the experience is both more enjoyable and can last a lot longer. You can think of yourself like a car, says Woods. “With that same tank of gas—with that same body—you’re able to get more miles per gallon,” she says. Another perk of a slower, longer run: it builds mental strength. Spending more time hitting the pavement will help you build up the mental endurance you need to run, says Roberts. Plus, this pace is more accessible, meaning more people can get in on the fun and build community.
The benefits of an easy run:
Builds up your aerobic base
Aids recovery
Allows you to run longer distances or times
Builds mental endurance
More accessible pace
How To Incorporate Slow Running Into Your Routine
It might take some time to determine what exactly a low-effort run feels like for you. One way to do this is to start to pay attention to how you feel during and after your runs. You can try the talk or sing test during, and you shouldn’t feel entirely depleted after. Keep in mind that every day might feel a little different too, says Woods. You don’t even need to be looking at your pace. If you listen to your body, you should be able to feel out the right speed for you, she says.
The biggest thing  to consider is training by time—not miles. Especially if you’re
running
at a slower pace, running a certain distance simply takes longer—but doesn’t necessarily add more benefits. Typically, the recreational runner doesn't need to be running for longer than three hours, Woods and Roberts agree. Rather than building up more endurance, anything past the three hour mark actually just puts you at risk for overuse injuries, explains Roberts.
Other considerations if you’re running for longer periods of time are
fueling
after 45 to 60 minutes and then again every 30 to 45 minutes (though this is super personal and requires some experimentation) and staying hydrated, says Woods. You also might need some more gear, like a running vest or belt to carry your sustenance.

Two important reminders: Make sure your form isn’t changing if you’re slowing down, says Roberts. Sometimes switching up your pace might affect your stride, which you want to make sure isn’t causing any injuries due to improper form. You’ll also want to get a dynamic warm-up in before a run, says Roberts.
If you’ve ever been called “slow”...
If you are a runner who has been told by others that you’re slow, consider this your reminder that it’s all relative, and you’re still a runner. You’re also not alone, says Roberts. People running 15-, 20-, 30-minute miles have always existed, but what’s changed is that now we get to see them thrive on our social media. Races might not be set up for slower runners—like, why do they start last when they need more time?—and this might make you feel like you’re not enough, says Roberts. Keep in mind that this isn’t true; your pace isn’t the problem. “Runners come in all different paces,” she says.

You can also find more confidence in a run group or community, adds Woods. Going on a group run might feel intimidating, but the right one will give you the support you need and let you in on a little secret: that most runners are just focused on themselves. Everyone is trying to do the best that they can possibly do, whether that makes them “slow” or “fast,” she says.

It’s not just you—more and more people are taking up running: Fitness-tracking app
Strava
saw a four percent increase in runs logged in 2023 and
New York Road Runners
, organizer of the
New York City Marathon
, saw an increase in demand across races of all distances—with many sold out—too. Whether you’re thinking of joining in on the running craze by trying out a run club or entering a race, training for a 5K is a good way to start.
A 5K is just a little over three miles (3.1, to be exact), and it’s actually a great distance for runners of all ages, fitness levels, and experience levels, according to Erica Coviello, owner and running coach at Run Fit Stoked. “I love a 5K because typically they're smaller races, so they really foster a sense of community, not just for runners, but anybody in the community,” she says. They’re also held pretty frequently, so if something goes wrong with training, the stakes aren’t as high as missing a once-a-year
marathon
.
Depending on your goals (like running the distance without stopping, getting a certain time, or using the race to prep for a longer one), the right training plan can set you up for success. Getting to the three-mile mark isn’t just about increasing your distance a little bit each day. A good 5K training plan incorporates the right mix of workouts and (thankfully) plenty of rest days too. Read on for your running coach-approved training schedule and some tips to crush your next 5K.
Meet the expert:
Erica Coviello
, CPT, is a level 2 certified RRCA running coach and owner of
Run Fit Stoked
.
Claudette Sariya
, CPT, is a personal trainer, fitness coach, and organizer of
Asian Women Stay Running (AWSTARS)
Run Club in NYC.
5K Training Plan Benefits
A 5K is an
aerobic
challenge, says Coviello. “That means you want to be able to get your heart in the condition to pump oxygen efficiently,” she says. By balancing different types of runs with
cross training
,
strength training
, and
rest days
, a plan can make sure you’re working—but not overworking—your muscles while getting your heart into the right condition.
5K FAQs
What is a “good” time for a 5K?
The answer to this question is going to be different for everybody, but Coviello says she’s noticed that people tend to like to work with round numbers. If you shoot for a 30-minute 5K, that means you’re running slightly faster than a ten-minute mile, which is a great goal for newer runners. But, the beauty of this distance is that it can be done much faster or slower than at a ten-minute pace. “Walkers can do this too,” Coviello says.

How long does it take to train for a 5K?
Coviello’s plan is eight weeks long, but you can likely speed up or slow down this training depending on your experience level. For example, if you’re already running a 5K distance but looking to shave off some time, you won’t need eight weeks to see results. If you’re a true beginner, you might want to give yourself more time—like 12 to 16 weeks instead—to really get your body used to the idea of moving quickly, Coviello says.
Her eight-week plan is a great starting point for those who already have a little bit of an aerobic base (a.k.a. you already do some
running
,
walking
,
swimming
, or other kinds of fitness activities).
What gear do I need to run a 5K?
Aside from the musts like a good pair of
running sneakers
, a lot of the running gear you’ll need is weather-dependent. In warmer weather, Coviello recommends light,
moisture-wicking clothes
. Plus, you’ll want to stay protected from the sun by wearing a hat or sunglasses and
sunscreen
. In
colder weather
, warm socks (like
Smartwool
), something to keep your ears and head warm, and lots of layers will be important.
In order to follow Coviello’s plan, you’ll also want some sort of
timing and tracking device
.

How To Prevent Injury While Training For a 5K
The best way to prevent injury is by getting a good
warm-up
in, and it only takes about five to ten minutes. A slow jog or walk, as will
dynamic stretching
, will help wake up your muscles before a run. One thing you should skip in your warm-up? Static stretching, says Coviello. This might actually make you more prone to getting an injury and is best done after a run.
Additionally, at any point in your training, you shouldn’t push through pain. If something hurts, you should take a rest (which is often what your body needs to remedy the issue, says Coviello), but if pain continues, you should consult a physical therapist or doctor.
The Plan
In Coviello’s 5K training plan, you’ll typically be running four days a week and resting for three. Take a look at the chart for all the details, and keep scrolling for a breakdown of all the kinds of runs you’ll be doing.
Hearst Owned
Easy Runs
Easy runs should be what they sound like: easy. They should be getting you to about 60 percent of your max heart rate, though you don’t need to focus on getting to an exact number, says Coviello. It’s more about the feel. “Easy is when you're not huffing and puffing and it's not difficult to take a breath,” says Coviello. “Even if you're running alone, you should be able to have a full conversation with a person running next to you without having to gasp for breath every couple words.” This is what runners call a conversational pace.
And, by the way, a majority of your runs in this training plan are easy.
Long Runs
Your long runs—done just once a week—should also be at a conversational pace, and they’re actually the most important run of all because they really train your muscles, connective tissue, and everything else you need to keep up with what you’re training your heart to do, says Coviello. “It really improves your aerobic system,” she says.
If a long run seems daunting to you, Coviello has two helpful tips. The first is that it is totally okay to walk if you need to take breaks. You’re still moving forward, after all. If you find that you need to walk a lot, that’s also potentially a sign that you’re starting out too fast. The second tip: Do your long run with a friend. Bringing someone else along not only keeps you entertained but is also a good way to tell if you’re running at a conversational pace, because, well, you should be able to have a conversation with them.
By the way, depending on the pace that’s comfortable for you, you might even find that you run further than a 5K during your long runs. That’s a good thing, says Coviello. It will make sure your endurance is there on race day.
Speed Runs
These days are less important for beginners (and can actually just be treated as easy days if you don’t have a time goal), but are the key for anyone who wants to run a 5K at a certain pace.
On each weekly speed run, you’ll rotate between running at a faster pace and a slower one. By increasing your speed for shorter amounts of time, you get your body and mind used to going at your goal race pace until you can do it for the entire time. “It just adds on a little bit each time so that by the time you get to that 5K, you're ready to run the whole race at that pace,” says Coviello.
Since the speed workout format may be new for some, here's an example of what it could look like:
Begin with a 5-10 minute warm-up jog (after any dynamic stretches you may choose to do)
Start your working intervals (e.g. six 2-minute intervals at goal race pace)
Recover (by walking or jogging slowly) in between each interval as prescribed (e.g. three minutes)
Repeat for as many working intervals as prescribed
Cool down with a light jog or walk
Rest Days
You can take all three days on this plan as true rest days, but there’s also the option to do a form of cross training too. Cross training should be another form of aerobic exercise. Think swimming, biking, using the elliptical—any form of
low-impact cardio
that you enjoy works. And, remember to take one full day for solely rest. Your body needs it!
Strength Training
Strength training
should be done two to three times a week, and only needs to take about 20 minutes, says Coviello. You can do strength training after a run or at least two hours before a run.
You're going to want to focus on the most important muscles for running when you're strength training. They include your
legs
,
glutes
,
calves
, and
core
, says Claudette Sariya, CPT, a personal trainer, fitness coach, and organizer of the Asian Women Stay Running run club in NYC. You can keep it simple and do
bodyweight exercises
, but adding resistance is the only way to grow your muscles, she adds.

Why Trust Us?
If your entire social media feed is flooded with friends and family
crushing marathon training
, then ‘tis the season! Personally, I feel more inspired with each celebratory post I see, but if you’re a rookie runner hoping to cross a finish line of your own, it can feel overwhelming. Training for
any
race takes planning, persistence, and lots of hard work, but the run/walk method can help you rock race day.
The run/walk method involves alternating between running and walking at timed intervals, says Kelli Sullivan, CPT, a personal trainer and RRCA-certified running coach. “Whether you're eyeing
your first 5K
or your 50th marathon, recovering from an injury, or looking to safely increase your mileage, the run/walk method can be your secret weapon.” Sullivan says the method was first designed by Jeff Galloway, author of
The Run Walk Run Method
.
The idea is that the planned walk breaks are a form of active recovery to help you build confidence and endurance without pushing yourself too hard, says Sara Hayes, an RRCA-certified running coach and founder of Mindful Miles. “The run/walk method is a great way to meet yourself where you’re at and scale as you’re ready,” she says.
Ahead, running coaches weigh in on everything you need to know about the run/walk method, including the benefits, potential risks, and best tips for getting started.
Meet the experts:
Kelli Sullivan
, CPT, is a certified personal trainer and RRCA-certified running coach.
Sara Hayes
, is a RRCA-certified running coach and founder of
Mindful Miles
﻿.
Jill Becke
r
, CPT, is a certified personal trainer and RRCA-certified running coach at
Life Time
.
What is the run/walk method?
As the name suggests, the run/walk method is when you alternate between
running
and walking intervals, says Hayes. “It helps reduce the physical and mental barriers to starting or reintroducing running by making it feel less overwhelming, and easing your body into movement, minimizing burnout and injury risk.”
That said, the run/walk method is for anyone and everyone, but it’s especially great for beginners, those returning from an injury, postpartum runners, or anyone feeling intimidated by continuous running, says Hayes.
The method could enable you to extend your overall workout time and gradually
build endurance
, Sullivan explains. It can also decrease your risk of injury since walking helps limit the continuous impact on your joints and muscles, adds Jill Becker, CPT, a personal trainer and RRCA-certified running coach at Life Time.

Another major perk? The method is easily customizable for any skill level, making it a versatile tool for long-term running development, says Sullivan. All you have to do is gradually adjust the running intervals when you’re ready to up the ante (more on that soon!).
How To Try The Run/Walk Method
Always warm-up.
Properly warming up
is crucial for activating your muscles and preventing injury, so Sullivan recommends starting with five to 10 minutes of brisk walking.
Dynamic stretches
like leg swings, high knees, and arm circles can also loosen you up for the upcoming workout, she adds.
Determine your intervals.
The ideal run/walk ratio depends on your fitness level and goals, so Sullivan recommends the below cheat-sheet for getting started. “There's no ‘perfect’ ratio because the best one is the one that allows you to complete your planned distance comfortably and safely, so listen to your body and adjust as needed,” she says.
Beginner:
Start with a 1:2 or 1:1 ratio
Example:
One-minute run, followed by a two-minute walk, or a one-minute run, followed by a one-minute walk
Intermediate:
Move to a 2:1 or 3:1 ratio
Example:
Two-minute run, followed by a one-minute walk, or a three-minute run, followed by a one-minute walk
Advanced:
Progress to a 4:1 or 5:1 ratio
Example:
Four-minute run, followed by a one-minute walk, or a five-minute run, followed by a one-minute walk
As for your total workout time, Becker suggests starting with 30 minutes and increasing by five minutes each week when you’re ready to level-up. Incorporating hills and more challenging terrain into your route will also up the difficulty, adds Sullivan.
Select your pace.
Choosing the right pace is crucial for successful run/walk training, so consider the following tips:
Start conservatively:
Your running pace should allow you to hold a conversation, so if you’re gasping for air, Sullivan says to slow down. If you’re new or returning to running, it’s also okay if your run is more like a brisk walk, adds Hayes.
Honor your walks:
Keep your walking intervals casual and go at your natural walking pace, says Hayes. The goal is to feel comfortable and like you can talk in complete sentences, per Becker.
Listen to your body:
If you're overly fatigued, Sullivan recommends slowing down. When your endurance is strong, you can slightly pick up the running pace, but avoid sprinting, says Hayes.
Commit to cooling down.
Cooling down
post-workout is essential for promoting recovery and preventing injury, so always finish with a five- to 10-minute walk after your final interval to gradually lower your heart rate, says Sullivan. From there, Becker recommends another five to 10 minutes of stretching and
mobility work
that focuses on your calves, quads, hamstrings, and
hip flexors
.

Risks Of The Run/Walk Method
One of the main risks is becoming too ambitious too quickly. “As you start to feel more capable during your run intervals, it can be tempting to push harder or skip the walking breaks altogether, but this can lead to burnout or injury, especially for beginners,” says Hayes. “It’s important to finish your run feeling like you could do more, [which] builds confidence and excitement for the next run, which will help develop consistency.”
On the flip side, if your goal is to eventually run continuously, you also want to be mindful that you don’t become over-reliant on your walking intervals, says Sullivan. “For some, the walk breaks might become a psychological crutch, limiting someone's belief in their ability to run continuously.”

Finally, the frequent transitions between running and walking can initially feel disruptive to your rhythm, says Hayes. This can also make it harder to regulate your body temperature in colder climates, though over time, those transitions will become more fluid, and your body will adjust to the intervals, adds Sullivan.

Frequently Asked Questions
What should you eat before a run/walk workout?
“It’s helpful to eat a small snack 30 to 60 minutes before a run to give your body the energy it needs,” says Hayes. Her suggestion for
quick, digestible fuel
that won’t feel heavy on the stomach? A banana with peanut butter or toast with honey and applesauce.
If you plan on running for more than 60 minutes, you also might need fuel during the workout itself, so Sullivan recommends experimenting with energy chews in this case.
Hydration is also key
, so it’s best to intentionally drink throughout the day and have about eight to 16 ounces of water 30 minutes before your workout, adds Sullivan.
Can you use the run/walk method during a race?
You, and many runners find it very effective, says Becker. The method can help you maintain a steady pace, preventing the common mistake of starting too fast and burning out, says Sullivan. If you’re running longer distances, regular walking breaks can also help you conserve energy for later in the race, potentially leading to stronger finish times, she adds. “Breaking the race into smaller, manageable segments can make the overall distance feel less daunting.”
Exactly when you walk during a race is up to you, but Becker says that water stations and uphill are great times to slow down and conserve energy.
How often should you do the run/walk method?
A lot comes down to your current fitness level and goals, but Becker recommends starting out three times per week, with at least one rest day between each session. This gives your body ample time to adapt and recover so you feel ready to go for your next workout. If you’re an advanced runner, Sullivan says you can increase the frequency up to four to five times a week.
Just remember that consistency is more important than volume, especially when starting out, says Hayes. “You know yourself and your schedule best, so if once or twice a week is more manageable for you, then start there.”

What To Know Before Running A Mile Every Day, According To Running Coaches
What To Know Before Running A Mile Every Day, According To Running Coaches
It might be the new goal you need.

Whenever I come back from a long break in running, I have a special trick that gets me on track with ease: running a mile a day. One mile takes somewhere between ten and fifteen minutes depending on how fast you’re going, so it’s super easy to motivate for—and it doesn’t overload your body after a period of not lacing up your sneakers. I’ll tell myself, “It’s only ten minutes,” and before I know it, I’ve left my apartment, circled the neighborhood, and enjoyed the
endorphin rush
that comes even after just one mile. By the end of the week, I get to feel accomplished, having a satisfying scroll through my
Strava
.
Whether you’re an experienced runner or brand new to the sport, setting this running goal works for a few reasons. The first is that it’s an appropriately-sized challenge. Even if running has never been your thing, working toward a daily mile is totally doable. Most people can safely run or walk a mile per day with little to no risk of injury, says Steve Stonehouse, CPT, USATF run coach. (Yep,
walking breaks
are totally acceptable!) The second reason is that it builds a routine. “Consistency is really more important than anything else that you're going to do,” says Erica Coviello, CPT, RRCA running coach and owner at Run Fit Stoked. Getting in the habit of running will set you up for success if you want to train for a longer distance later on, like a
5K
.
Seasoned runners also stand to benefit from running a mile every day. "If you already have a regular running routine, increasing up to daily runs could improve your stamina and mood, too," adds Rebecca Kennedy, CPT, Peloton Master Tread Instructor. It’s also helpful during an off-season, so that you don’t abandon your routine entirely and need to start from scratch (like me). Running a mile a day allows you to maintain fitness in the offseason without overdoing it, says Coviello.
Meet the experts:
Erica Coviello
, CPT, is a level 2 certified RRCA running coach and owner of
Run Fit Stoked
. Steve Stonehouse, CPT, USATF run coach, is the former director of education for
STRIDE
.
Rebecca Kennedy
, CPT, is a
Peloton Master Tread Instructor
.
So, if you need a little extra push to get moving, this is it. But before you set that daily reminder to get out there and log that mile, there are a few things the pros want you to keep in mind.
First, what are the benefits of running a mile a day?
As long as you do it safely (more on that soon), running a mile a day is a great way to support your overall health and fitness.
"You get all the benefits of running in general, like supporting cardiorespiratory fitness and bone health, without the volume of mileage that can potentially cause injury," says Stonehouse. More
benefits of running
? Stress relief, getting you outside, and improved sleep. It could also give you a mental health boost, according to one 2020 review in
The International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health
.
If you’re a beginner, running a mile a day is a great way to get your body used to running without overdoing it, says Coviello. It will also help you build a routine
and
give you time to recover. For experienced runners, running a short distance daily will allow you to maintain fitness, give your body a break from more intense distances, and stay consistent.

Is running one mile a day enough exercise?
It depends. Though logging a daily mile can be a great way to get moving and support your health and fitness goals, it won’t quite land you in the 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity and two days of muscle-strengthening activity per week territory that the
Center for Disease Control
recommends. But, if running a mile a day is your first step to building out your fitness routine, it’s a great start, says Coviello.
If you have a performance-based goal like building muscle (or even want to reap the full cardiovascular benefits that come with running), you’ll need to increase your mileage. "Low-intensity cardio does not lead to muscle gain, a.k.a.
hypertrophy
," says Kennedy. If you run a mile at an easier or more moderate pace, you rely on
type I (a.k.a. slow-twitch) muscle fibers
, which support endurance exercise. (Picture a marathon runner.)
However, "sprinting is a great way to focus on muscle gain," Kennedy says. Sprinting recruits more muscle fibers, specifically
type II (a.k.a. fast-twitch) muscle fibers
, which support power production.
A surefire way to build that muscle? This equipment-free workout sculpts your lower body from home:
That said, sprinting just a total of one mile a day likely isn't enough to make noticeable muscle gains, says Kennedy. "In order to really put on muscle, you need to lift weights, eat enough to support muscle tissue breakdown and protein synthesis, and get adequate recovery."
Ultimately, can sprints support your progress? Totally. But will they do the job on their own? Not so much.

Here's *Exactly* What To Eat Before Your Run
Can you lose weight by running a mile a day?
A 155-pound person burns about 360 calories in 30 minutes of running at a 10 minute/mile pace, according to
Harvard Medical School
. Run a single mile at that pace and you'll burn about 120 calories.
While that's definitely something, it's likely not going to keep you progressing toward your goals long-term. Weight loss also depends on a lot of other factors, like genetics, nutrition, and the other activities you’re doing.
If
weight loss
is your ultimate goal, you'll want to focus on training that helps you
burn fat efficiently and build muscle
. Which is why, ultimately, just running a mile a day won't do much to move the needle towards your long-term weight-loss goals; it simply doesn't burn enough
calories
. (Not sure what to try? These are the
top calorie-burning exercises
.)
Are there any risks with running a mile a day?
Running one mile a day is generally safe because it’s a short distance, says Coviello, but like with running in general there are risks including
plantar fasciitis
,
shin splints
, runner’s knee, or
IT band
pain. “Just a mile is usually not going to be the thing that puts you over that edge,” though, she says. If you are experiencing any pain while running, you shouldn’t push through it. All of those issues are best resolved with a run coach or physical therapist.
If you don't have a current running routine, it’s okay to work your way up to running daily and incorporate
rest days
in between runs—this can also minimize your risk of overuse injuries. You can also run-walk, says Coviello. Break up your mile with regular running and walking intervals until you feel comfortable running the entire time.
One time when running a mile a day might be too much? If you’re adding it on top of a workout routine. You’re going to want to give your body some time to recover, so don’t let a daily run set you over the edge.
Still, though, "running daily is not for everyone, just like power lifting every day isn't advisable," Kennedy says. So don't feel like if you haven't tried running a mile a day that you're missing out. There are plenty of other ways to reap similar benefits. One of the biggest things to keep in mind is that, while you can totally build a tolerance to daily runs, switching up how you move from day to day can keep you feeling fresh, both in body and in mind.
How To Start Running A Mile A Day
If you’re a beginner, you don’t necessarily need to even run the full mile. Take walking breaks when you need them, or try switching between running and
walking
intervals, decreasing the walking intervals overtime. Another important thing to keep in mind: “Slow down when it feels hard,” says Coviello. By taking your mile slowly, you’ll find more stamina to keep going.
As for building this daily mile into your schedule, creating visual cues or a reward system might also help. Coviello recommends using a calendar or chart and checking off when you complete a run. You can also use a running app. And, at the end of the week, you can celebrate your runs with a coffee from your favorite shop, she says.
Kennedy says her go-to way of incorporating a one-mile run into daily exercise is as a finisher. "It's an incredible way to feel accomplished at the end of a workout," she says. Whatever gas you've got left in the tank, burn through it in that mile. Or, if you take your daily mile at an easier pace, it works well as a warm-up, too.

Why Trust Us?
Whether you’re out for a
hot girl walk
or scrolling through
TikTok
, you might be spotting more and more women sporting a weighted vest  during physical activity. The trend has taken off as a simple way to boost your daily steps, claiming benefits like burning more calories and building muscle. But does it live up to the hype? And more importantly, are the benefits of a weighted vest for walking worth the investment?
In short, yes. A
weighted vest
can be a practical, affordable, and effective way to level-up your existing fitness routine, with some of our top picks ringing in under $50 (more on this below). The added resistance that comes from a weighted vest increases the challenge of familiar exercises without the need to change form or add complex movements, according to Sarah Pelc Graca, CPT, a personal trainer and founder of Strong with Sarah Weight Loss Coaching. "A weighted vest transforms walking from a simple activity into a more challenging,
full-body workout
," says Pelc Graca.
Whether you're walking, running, or doing bodyweight exercises like squats or lunges, the extra resistance elevates the intensity. And unlike more traditional resistance equipment such as dumbbells or resistance bands, a weighted vest proposes a hands-free solution to up the ante of moves you're already doing. “This added resistance helps increase cardiovascular intensity, build strength, and improve bone density, making it a versatile addition to fitness routines,” she says. Many women also use a weighted vest for weight loss since they burn more calories (we'll dive deeper into this later on).
Sounds pretty good, right? Ahead, experts weigh in on the trend, along with how to properly incorporate a weighted vest into your routine.

Is Walking Good Exercise? A Trainer Breaks It Down
Benefits Of Walking With A Weighted Vest
Improves bone density.
Walking with a weighted vest can promote healthy
bone density
, which is crucial for aging women, who face a higher risk of osteoporosis (a condition that causes bones to become weak and brittle), says Pelc Graca. “The added weight provides a mild form of resistance, encouraging bones to adapt and become stronger, and this type of weight-bearing exercise is particularly beneficial for women post-menopause, as bone density naturally decreases during this stage of life.”
Adds a strength training element.
Walking is already great exercise
, but incorporating a weighted vest turns a casual stroll into a strength-building exercise. “The extra weight increases the workload on muscles in the legs, glutes, and core, effectively blending strength training into a low-impact cardio routine,” says Pelc Graca. As a result, walking with a weighted vest is an accessible and simple way for women to
enhance muscle tone
and strength without needing to lift traditional weights, says Hooman Melamed, MD, an orthopedic spine surgeon and founder of The Spine Pro.
Boosts cardiovascular health.
Wearing a weighted vest boosts the cardiovascular intensity of an average stroll by increasing your heart rate, in turn, improving overall
stamina and heart health
, says Pelc Graca. The harder the workout, the higher the heart rate, which also means your body can more efficiently move oxygen and blood to your muscles, says Dr. Melamed. This helps burn more calories, shed fat, lower cholesterol level, and reduce high blood pressure, he says.
Promotes better posture.
A weighted vest engages your core muscles and encourages a more
upright posture
during walks, says Pelc Graca. The added weight requires stabilization from the abdominal and spinal muscles, leading to
improved balance
and a stronger core, which can be especially beneficial for women who spend a lot of time sitting or experience posture-related issues, she says.
Burns calories.
If you’re on a
weight loss
journey, Dr. Melamed says a weighted vest burns more calories faster, while simultaneously building muscle. And the more muscle mass you have, the higher your resting metabolic rate is, allowing your body to burn more calories at rest, adds Pelc Graca.

Here’s What You Get Out Of Walking A Mile A Day
The Best Walking Shoes For Women
How often should I wear a weighted vest?
When it comes to wearing a weighted vest for walking, experts recommend to start slow and progressively increase frequency and duration. “Prolonged use (several hours) can lead to joint strain,
muscle fatigue
, and posture issues if the weight is too heavy or worn for too long, so it’s important to gradually introduce weight and duration to avoid overloading your body,” says Pelc Graca.
You can technically wear a weighted vest every time you walk or work out, but it’s smart to progressively ease into a routine to get used to the added resistance. “Start by using a weighted vest one to two times per week on familiar walks to allow your body to adapt without overloading your muscles or joints,” says Pelc Graca. As you
build strength
and endurance, you can gradually increase the frequency to walking with a weighted vest on three to five times a week, or wearing it for bodyweight workouts, she suggests.
As for how long to wear it, it's generally not recommended to wear a weighted vest for extended periods, especially if you’re a beginner. Initially, it’s best to limit your sessions to 10 to 20 minutes, or a moderate distance such as a mile, Pelc Graca says. “Over time, as your body adjusts to the added weight, you can increase the duration or distance of your walks, but gradually building up duration helps minimize the risk of injury."
How To Choose The Right Weighted Vest
A lot comes down to current fitness levels and personal goals, but Dr. Melamed recommends beginners opt for
a weighted
vest that weighs no more than 10 percent of their body weight. For example, if you weigh 150 pounds, a 15-pound vest is the heaviest you should go. If you’re completely new to exercise, Pelc Graca recommends going even lighter and opting for a vest that weighs around five percent of your body weight (around seven pounds if you weigh 150 pounds).
Your vest should also fit snugly and securely to avoid extra movement during a workout. A poorly fitted vest can cause discomfort, throw off your balance, and result in poor posture, says Pelc Graca. Many vests also come with adjustable straps, which allows for a more personalized and comfortable fit.

A WH Editor's Review Of The Omorpho Weighted Vest
Potential Drawbacks Of Wearing A Weighted Vest
Joint and muscle strain.
Walking with a weighted vest is generally pretty safe for most folks, but overdoing it can lead to joint strain, especially in the
knees
,
hips
, and
lower back
, says Pelc Graca. "The added weight increases the load on these joints, which can lead to overuse injuries, particularly if the vest is too heavy or used too frequently." Those with existing joint problems such as arthritis, chronic knee, hip, or back pain should check with their healthcare provider before trying a weighted vest since the added load can increase stress, potentially worsening the condition or causing injury, she adds.
Poor posture.
If your vest is improperly fitted or too heavy, it can do funky things to your
posture
. “Carrying excessive weight—especially if it's ill-fitting—may cause you to hunch forward or alter your natural walking gait, leading to back or neck pain, and incorrect posture can strain the spine and affect overall body mechanics,” Pelc Graca says. Pregnant women should also avoid weighted vests since it can place unnecessary strain on the lower back and abdomen, exacerbating postural issues or lower back pain (which are already common during pregnancy), she says.
Increased risk of injury.
Using a weighted vest during walking increases the intensity of the workout, but if done without proper progression, it can lead to overtraining injuries like muscle strains or tendonitis, Pelc Graca says. “People new to resistance training may push too hard, too fast, which is why starting with a lighter load and gradually increasing the weight is critical for success.” Those with
osteoporosis
should also be extra cautious when using a weighted vest since the risk of fractures or bone injury increases with improper use, she adds.
Discomfort and chafing.
Wearing a weighted vest for extended periods can cause discomfort or chafing, particularly around the shoulders and chest, and particularly if the vest doesn't fit you right, notes Pelc Graca. Fortunately, she says this can be mitigated with proper fit, padding, and moisture-wicking clothing.
WH
editors recommend looking for a vest with an adjustable design to ensure a comfortable fit.
Muscular imbalance.
If the vest doesn’t distribute weight evenly or is worn incorrectly, it can lead to muscle imbalances, says Pelc Graca. As a result, the uneven weight distribution can cause asymmetry in the body, leading to compensatory movements that may stress certain muscles or joints disproportionately, she says.
To minimize risks, Dr. Melamed says to
always warm-up
, start with a
lighter weight
, ensure proper fit, and progressively increase resistance. You should also focus on maintaining good posture when walking or exercising with a weighted vest to reduce the risk of back strain, adds Pelc Graca. Keep your shoulders back, chest up, and core engaged to prevent rounding your spine or slumping forward.
How To Incorporate A Weighted Vest Into Your Routine
Aerobics Exercise
Wearing a weighted vest while walking, running, or climbing stairs is a simple way to
boost cardiovascular fitness
and build strength in the lower-body and core, says Pelc Graca. If you have access to a treadmill, the
12-3-30 workout
with a weighted vest is an efficient workout if you’re short on time. Walking isn’t the only way to use a weighted vest, so Pelc Graca says it’s worth experimenting with different styles of training (directly below!) to shake things up.
Bodyweight Exercises
A weighted vest can add intensity to common bodyweight exercises, making them more effective for building strength and endurance, says Pelc Graca. Try adding the vest to squats, pushups, lunges, and planks, or join the
Women’s Health+ Ultimate 4-Week Bodyweight Challenge
for a full program of workouts that are weighted vest-friendly!
Plyometrics
For a dynamic workout that combines strength and cardiovascular benefits, Pelc Graca recommends incorporating a weighted vest into
plyometric exercises
(jump training). Examples of movements you could do include jump squats, high knees, butt kickers, and box jumps.
High-Intensity Interval Training
Incorporating a weighted vest into a high-intensity interval training
(HIIT) workout
can enhance caloric burn and increase the cardiovascular challenge, says Pelc Graca. Her suggestion? Combine exercises like burpees, mountain climbers, and jumping jacks with short bursts of effort and minimal rest between sets.
Resistance Training
If you’re looking to boost the intensity of your
resistance training
, try wearing a weighted vest during exercises such as
pullups
, chinups, or triceps dips, says Pelc Graca. Not only will it increase difficulty, but the vest provides continuous resistance throughout the workout, forcing your muscles to work harder to support the added weight, she says.
Can walking with a weighted vest help with weight loss?
Yes. A weighted vest can absolutely
help with weight loss
(if that’s your goal), since it enhances caloric burn and builds muscle, Dr. Melamed says. The added resistance makes your muscles work harder during walks (or any exercise), and this additional effort requires more energy, leading to increased calorie expenditure, says Pelc Graca. In fact, adding even a small amount of extra weight can kick your heart rate and oxygen consumption up a notch, resulting in a higher calorie burn compared to walking without the added resistance, she says. Not only will this challenge your cardiovascular system, but it helps support fat loss over time.
Walking with a weighted vest also helps
build lean muscle
, especially in your legs and
core
, and more muscle mass means a higher resting metabolic rate (a.k.a. the number of calories your body burns at rest), explains Pelc Graca.

Why Trust Us?
Right up there with a
balanced diet
, strength training is the OG biohack for
longevity
, and the key to a strong, healthy body. But whether you’re a beginner or seasoned athlete, that begs the question:
H
ow much strength training do you actually need to see results?
If you look to the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
for answers, they say that adults need at least two days of “muscle-strengthening activity" per week for their overall health. But, resistance training even once a week was enough to make progress for beginners, per a
recent study
in
BMC Sports Science, Medicine and Rehabilitation.
"While it may seem the small amount of volume would be insignificant, this study demonstrates that some exercise is better than no exercise,”  says certified personal trainer Natalya Vasquez.  But as your skill level progresses, you’ll need to increase the intensity and volume of your workouts to
elicit more muscle growth
.
Below, experts explain exactly how much strength training is enough based on your fitness level and goals.
Meet the experts:
Tina Tang
, CPT, is a certified personal trainer, strength coach, and founder of
Iron Strong Fitness
.
Natalya Vasquez
, CPT, is a certified personal trainer, health coach, and founder of
On Your Terms Coaching
.
What is the minimum amount of strength training I need to do?
The following cheat-sheet will give you an idea of how many days a week you should strength train.
You’re a beginner with a goal of building muscle and strength.
While once a week was enough for the folks in the aforementioned study to make progress, they only looked at a single exercise: the leg press. Vasquez says that ideally, beginners looking to build total-body muscle and strength should start with
two, or even three, nonconsecutive strength training sessions per week
.
This frequency helps build a habit (key for those just starting out) and provides your body with the necessary stimulus for initial
muscle growth
, while also allowing for plenty of time to recover. But, your sessions don't have to be long: Initially, each session can be as short as 15 to 20 minutes, and you can gradually increase to 45- to 60-minute workouts as you build endurance, says certified personal trainer Tina Tang, CPT.
As for how you structure your workouts, Vasquez says you can either do two to three
full-body workouts
, or a three-day split, like a
push/pull/legs workout
, where your training is organized by muscle group.
For a full-body routine, Vasquez suggests completing one exercise per muscle group for three to five sets of five to eight reps per workout. For a three-day split, complete three to four exercises for the same muscle group for two to three sets of five to eight reps.
Vasquez likes the five to eight rep range because she says this helps develop functional hypertrophy: “We don’t just want to gain muscle, we want to have actual strength where this muscle growth is functional,” she says.
“You don’t need complicated gym equipment to get results,” says Vasquez. “
Dumbbells
and
bands
are affordable, convenient, and versatile options for exercising at home, and as your strength increases, gym access may be beneficial since it’ll give you additional equipment and a wider selection of weights.”

Women's Health
's "best overall" ranking.
You already lift and want to keep progressing.
In this case, the trainers suggest strength training
three times a week
, and depending on the intensity and volume of the workout, each session should range between 30 to 60 minutes, Tang says. “This frequency is effective for preserving muscle mass and strength while ensuring
adequate recovery
and adaptation.”
However, overall volume may be more important that days per week, according to a 2021
review
in
Sports Medicine
. The researchers conclude that it's possible to see gains by training anywhere from one to four days per week so long as you're getting in at least four sets of six to 15 reps per muscle group per week.
The key here will be to follow the principle of
progressive overload
. Gradually increasing the weight, sets and or reps, over time will continually challenge the muscles, stimulate growth, and improve bone density, says Tang. “The body craves movement, and once it's accustomed to a certain level of activity, it needs more of a challenge to keep making gains."

You already lift and want to maintain.
Good news: The longer you’ve been strength training, the less work you’ll need to maintain your gains since your muscles are composed of more fibers, says Vasquez. “So if you’ve been strength training five times per week for a decade and then something happens in your life that doesn’t allow you to work out as much, you’ll still be able to maintain your muscle with
one full-body workout per week
,” she says. However, this would be the bare minimum, and resistance training two to three times a week is still the ideal sweet spot.
In terms of the type of training, Tang also recommends full-body workouts to maintain balanced muscle development and overall strength. Look to hit all the
major movement patterns
for best results. For each exercise, Vasquez says to aim to complete three to five sets of five to eight reps.
You’re a runner and want to ward off injury—without sacrificing endurance.
Aside from logging miles, strength training at least
twice a week
is a crucial part of every
running regimen
, says Tang. “Ideally, one session can focus on bilateral, foundational movements, while a second session allows for a more specialized approach, targeting unilateral exercises, core stability, and hip strength,” she explains. “This balance ensures you're not only building overall strength but also addressing the specific needs that support running performance and injury prevention.”
Indeed, the addition of two to four strength training sessions a week helped mid- to long-distance runners prevent injury and run faster, according to
a 2024 meta-analysis
in the journal
Sports Medicine
.

Workouts should range between 30 to 60 minutes and rep ranges can vary from five to eight (with heavier weight and for more advanced strength trainers) to 12 to 20 reps (for runners newer to strength training and using lighter weights), Vasquez says.
FWIW, the meta-analysis notes that
plyometric training
and "high load" strength training (using weights at 80% of your one rep max or heavier), specifically, improved running economy.
You want to do the bare minimum to protect your bones and joints.
For this goal, Tang says to strength train at least
twice a week
. Doing so "helps build and
maintain muscle mass
and bone density, which is crucial for protecting bones and joints as we age, and this frequency provides a balance between stimulating the muscles and allowing for adequate recovery,” she says.
Plus, regular resistance training helps strengthen tendons and ligaments, in turn, supporting joint
stability
and overall musculoskeletal health, she adds.

Full-body workouts and compound exercises like deadlifts, overhead presses, and squats are ideal since they involve multiple joints and mimic how your body moves in real life, says Vasquez. Depending on your experience, this could look like choosing two to three exercises and doing three to five sets for five to eight reps (to focus on building functional strength) per workout.
Why You Need To Strength Train Regularly
No matter your goals, strength training is certainly worth your time. Aside from supporting your overall wellbeing, picking up weights can prevent injury,
improve metabolic health
, reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, and support bone density, especially in women, says Vasquez.
In fact, approximately
one in five women
over age 50 have osteoporosis (a condition that causes bones to become weak and brittle), but strength training can help enhance bone density and reduce the risk of fractures, says Tang.
Sarcopenia
, an age-related progressive loss of muscle mass strength, is another common condition among women, and after age 30, you can gradually begin losing muscle mass each decade. Fortunately, strength training can again help combat the effects and reverse muscle loss, says Tang.
Finally, regular weight training supports balance,
mobility
, and functional strength which are crucial for performing daily activities and living independently, Tang says. “Strength training acts as an investment in our future health, ensuring that we maintain physical strength and resilience for the long term.”

Why Trust Us?
Whether you’re a lifelong marathoner or you just joined a run club yesterday, lacing up your sneakers and hitting the trail can be great for your mind, body, and can even jumpstart weight loss.
However, how many calories you burn while running depends on a lot of factors, experts say. There are ways to optimize your workout to maximize results, if losing weight is your goal.
Running has a variety of benefits including physical, mental, and emotional, per a 2020 review published in the
International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health
.
And while it’s not necessarily an overnight solution for weight loss (it’s a marathon after all, not a sprint!), running consistently helps you torch calories and potentially lose weight over time, experts say.
Here is everything you need to know about calories burned while running, how much you should run to lose weight, and how to ramp up your routine for safe, sustainable success.
Meet the experts:
Kristen Hislop
, is an ACE personal trainer, certified triathlon coach, and owner of
Hislop Coaching
.
Alesha Courtney
, CPT, is a fitness trainer, nutritionist, and coach in private practice.
Albert Matheny
, RD, CSCS, is the CEO of
Promix Nutrition
and co-founder of
SoHo Strength Lab
.
Ash Wilking

Hallie Labrador
, MD, is a primary care sports medicine physician at Endeavor Health.
How many calories can you burn running?
In general, most people tend to burn about 100 calories per mile, says certified trainer and coach Kristen Hislop, owner of Hislop Coaching. It’s hard to pinpoint a universal number, though, since the exact number of calories you can burn depends on many factors like age, sex, and
metabolic rate
, she says.
Your
menstrual cycle
also plays a role, since you tend to burn more calories after ovulation in the luteal phase, Hislop says. This isn’t to say you should automatically quit running at a certain time of the month, but know that if you don’t feel at your strongest during certain times of your cycle, it’s totally normal and expected. “[If] some runs feel fantastic and others are flat, there is a reason,” she says.
Your body weight can also impact how many calories you burn while running. The more you weigh, the more calories you’ll burn, and vice versa, Hislop says. “Men tend to have a higher metabolic rate because, on average, they weigh more and have a lower percentage of body fat,” Hislop says.
If you want to know the exact number of calories your body burns while running, you can get your
resting metabolic rate
(RMR) and
VO2 max
tested at a gym or clinic. “RMR is the number of calories you need to function doing normal activities,” Hislop says. VO2 max, which is often used as an indicator of overall cardiorespiratory fitness, can also serve as a metric for tracking progress, she says. These tests can help you determine how many calories you burn in your everyday life (just by existing) and how many calories you burn while exercising, Hislop says.

Is walking or running better for weight loss?
Although both activities can be beneficial for weight loss, running tends to burn more calories than walking, says personal trainer Alesha Courtney, CPT. That’s because running burns more in less time, which may lead to faster results, she says.
But if you’re new to working out or have an injury, walking can still help you lose, says Albert Matheny, RD, CSCS, the CEO of Promix Nutrition and co-founder of SoHo Strength Lab.
Plus, it’s sustainable and pretty safe. “Since walking can burn calories and increase your heart rate without too much effort from your body, you can do it more often and for longer durations,” says Ash Wilking, a NASM-certified personal trainer based in New York City.
The bottom line? The ideal option is the one that works best for
you

How Much To Walk Or Run For Weight Loss
Walking five to six times a week or running three to four times a week can help you reach your weight loss goals, Wilking says. Remember to schedule rest days and cross-training sessions in between those days to ensure optimal time for recovery, too, she says.
Pace, distance, and speed are a personal choice, but
monitoring your heart rate
can help you determine the optimal amount for you, Wilking says. The slower your pace, the longer you can go in running or walking and the more sustainable and safe your workout will be.
Zone 2 training
, a steady-state workout that’s performed at an easy to moderate level of intensity, can be a great place to start, Hislop says. This type of exercise can increase metabolic efficiency—basically, your ability to switch between using fat and carbs for energy, which is what you want to strive for when trying to lose weight, she says. (And if you’ve hit a
weight loss plateau
recently, keeping track of your heart rate can also let you know when it’s time to go a little harder.)

How To Optimize Your Workout For Calorie Burn
If you’re new to working out, aim for a low-intensity, attainable walking routine that does not seem overwhelming, says Doug Sklar, a NASM-certified personal trainer, obstacle race coach, running coach, and owner of the fitness training studio PhilanthroFIT. Then, over a period of a few weeks, increase the time and intensity of your walking, he says.
Then, when you need a challenge, add an incline to your walk or run, says Wilking.
A 135-pound woman running on an incline of five percent might burn about 128 calories per mile. If the same woman was jogging up flights of stairs for nine minutes, she might roughly burn about 154 calories, according to Wilking.
Another way to up calorie burn is speed. If you’re on a treadmill, increasing your speed from 3.0 to 4.0 could help you burn an additional 10 calories per mile, Wilking says. Add an incline and you might burn three to five more calories per minute, possibly adding a 50 to 60 percent increase in calorie burn per mile.
Frequently Asked Questions
What other forms of exercise can help me burn calories?
Good news: Just about any type of aerobic exercise can increase calorie burn. Rowing, cycling, and high intensity interval training (HIIT) classes can help get your heart rate up and help you burn more, Hislop says. Swimming is also super effective and is great for boosting heart health, she adds.
Adults typically need 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity every week, according to the
Center for Disease Control
(CDC). Alternatively, you can also do 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity physical activity. Adults also need at least two days of muscle-strengthening activity each week, so all the more reason to add some weights to your workout routine.
A good weekly goal would be to do a couple of
strength training
sessions, one really hard workout, and three to four lower-intensity aerobic workouts (meaning you can still hold a conversation while doing them), says Hislop.
It is also super important that people have a recovery day. “You will not lose weight, gain muscle, gain cardiovascular benefits, or be able to be consistent if you do not allow your body to recover,” says Hislop. “It is during recovery that we make the gains!”

How many calories do I need to consume for my runs?
What you eat should match your training, says Hislop. Have some fuel
before a run
(bananas, applesauce, crackers, bread, and peanut butter are popular options), and within 30 minutes of wrapping your workout, aim for protein and carbs, Hislop says. “For most people, eating protein can help get the body into a fat-burning state—and it also helps with muscle repair and recovery,” she says. “You would not try to drive your car across the state on an empty tank, so your body will not go far on empty,” she says.
“There is no one-size-fits-all calorie recommendation for runners,” says Hallie Labrador, MD, a primary care sports medicine physician at Endeavor Health. But if you’re running for more than one hour, you should generally aim to consume 60 to 90 grams of carbohydrates per hour during your run, she says.
High-carb sports drinks
, energy gels (like
Gu
or
SiS
), and even
fruit snacks
can help provide a boost, per
Johns Hopkins Medicine
. Fueling your body will help you avoid hitting “the wall”—essentially, when the body runs out of carbohydrate stores and has to switch to burning fat, Dr. Labrador says. “This can cause fatigue and cause your pace to drop.”
If you’re running short distances with the goal of losing weight, you probably do not need to increase your calorie intake by much, says Dr. Labrador. “But if you are running long distances, like
marathon training
, and/or you’re underweight to begin with or have a high metabolic rate, you should increase your calorie intake,” she says. If you enjoy doing speedwork, make sure you’re fueling with carbohydrates to keep up the intensity.

Running has
s
oooo
many benefits
. Just to name a few, it's good for your heart health, strengthens your bones, and reduces stress. It's also known to burn quite a few calories, making it a solid workout choice if you're looking to lose weight.
Plus, running works your muscles and has positive effects on the metabolism, says Leigh Daigle, MD, a board-certified obesity medicine physician at Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare. That said, it's always wise to loop in your doctor or healthcare pro any time you’re considering picking up a new fitness routine, especially if you have specific medical concerns.
Before you lace up and attempt to run for miles, there are a few things you need to know about running for weight loss, including how to get started and nutrition tips to support your journey. Ahead, experts break it down.
Meet the experts:
Leigh Daigle,
MD, is a board-certified obesity medicine physician at
Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare
.
Dani Rancourt
, RD is a certified sports dietitian and founder of
Pivot Nutrition Coaching
.
Sarah Pelc Graca
, CPT, is a certified personal trainer and founder of
Strong with Sarah Weight Loss Coaching
.
Is running good for weight loss?
We repeat: Running can be a great way to lose weight,
but
it's not a magic solution, says Dr. Daigle. On its own, running won’t necessarily induce weight loss, but it can lead to significant weight loss when *combined* with a healthy diet and regular
strength training routine
, she says.
After all, at its core, successful weight loss requires a
calorie deficit
(consuming fewer calories than your body requires to stay at its current weight), says dietitian Dani Rancourt, RD, founder of Pivot Nutrition Coaching. “A calorie deficit can be created one of three ways: reducing calorie intake, increasing calorie expenditure via exercise, or a combination of both, and research shows that the combination of exercise and dietary interventions produces more weight loss than dieting alone,” she says. “Running can certainly be beneficial in helping someone lose weight, however, it’s important to note that you can’t out-run a poor diet.”
With that in mind, running can definitely support your weight loss goals since it burns around 100 calories per mile, says Rancourt. It’s also a full-body workout that engages your legs, glutes, and core which helps increase muscle mass and
boost your metabolism
, in turn, supporting your weight loss goals, adds Dr. Daigle.
Now may be wondering,
“Does running burn belly fat?”
Well, it depends. Running can certainly help burn belly fat (also known as visceral fat), however it’s not possible to target a certain area to lose weight, says Rancourt. If you want to burn belly fat, it’s a multifaceted approach that requires a balanced diet full of fruits, veggies, and fiber,
resistance training
, limited alcohol, and
stress management
, *in addition* to a running routine, she says.

How Many Steps A Day Should I Take To Lose Weight?
How much running should I do in a day to lose weight?
Generally speaking, the
American College of Sports Medicine
(ACSM) recommends that adults get at least 150 to 300 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity (like brisk walking, bike riding, ballroom dancing, or even general yard work and home repair) or 75 to 150 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity (like running, tennis, or heavy yard work) per week. Adults should also incorporate muscle-strengthening activities into their routines, like
lifting weights
and working with resistance bands, per ACSM.
When it comes to distance and duration, you must take into consideration your baseline fitness level, says Rancourt. Beginners should start running or walking short distances—between half a mile to one mile—and gradually increase over time, says Dr. Daigle. If you're an intermediate runner with some movement experience already, aim for 1.5 to three miles per session, she says. Finally, if you're more advanced, aim for three to six miles per workout.
In addition to steady-state running, high-intensity interval running, which involves short bursts of intense running (like sprints) followed by periods of rest, is also worth your time, Dr. Daigle says. Not only will it spike your heart rate, but
HIIT intervals burn lots of calories
even after you’ve finished working out.
All that said, you don't have to exclusively run, because
any
form of cardio or movement will burn calories and help you lose weight, says Sarah Pelc Graca, CPT, a certified personal trainer and founder of Strong with Sarah Weight Loss Coaching. If you're new to running or exercise in general, start small and aim for one or two 15- to 30-minute
cardio workouts
per week, whether that's walking, biking, or using the elliptical, she says. Once you build endurance, you can work your way up to a jog or run. "It can be easy to want to 'jump the gun' and commit to doing four or five days of cardio workouts right from the start because you feel motivated on your weight loss journey, but I recommend starting out small so that you can consistently execute your workouts safely," she says.
And if you don’t catch the running bug, don’t force it! “If it’s not enjoyable, it’s not sustainable, and if you hate running, you’re likely not going to stick with it long-term, which is going to make it extremely difficult to maintain weight loss,” says Rancourt. Running is not the only way to lose weight, and
walking
,
swimming
, or
biking
are other great aerobic workouts to up your heart rate and support weight loss.

Nutrition Tips For Running
Nutrition is crucial when it comes to successful weight loss—whether you’re running or not. However, all vigorous exercise, including running, can increase hunger due to the
higher caloric burn
and potential hormonal and metabolic changes (running increases muscle mass which
increases metabolism
), says Dr. Daigle.
As a result, the goal is to create blood sugar-balancing meals and snacks containing protein, fiber, and healthy fats to increase energy levels and reduce hunger—which ultimately makes fat loss more manageable, says Rancourt.
To break it down a bit more,
protein
is the key macronutrient when it comes to fat loss because it regulates blood sugars, keeps you fuller for longer, and helps maintain muscle mass while in a calorie deficit, says Rancourt. So, try to incorporate
high-protein foods
like fish, chicken, beef, tofu, Greek yogurt, and eggs at each meal, she says.

A diet rich in
healthy fats
(like nuts, seeds, avocado, and olives) and complex carbohydrates (like whole grains, fruits, veggies) and low in processed foods and sugar will also fuel your workouts while maximizing weight loss results, adds Dr. Daigle.
When it comes to eating pre- and post-run, fueling before a workout generally requires more
carbohydrates
, as carbs are the preferred fuel source of muscles, says Rancourt. So, if you’re crushing a 6 a.m. run, your best bet is to have 15 to 30 grams of low-fiber carbs (like a banana) 15 to 30 minutes beforehand to provide your body with a dose of fuel, she explains.
After a run, eat a balanced meal full of protein, carbs, fruits, and veggies within an hour, Rancourt recommends. If a full meal isn’t doable, consume a
post-workout snack
ASAP containing protein, carbs, and fluids (like a fruit smoothie made with Greek yogurt or protein powder), she adds.
Last but not least, if you’re focusing on
low-carb foods
right now, prioritize eating carbs around your workouts to help you fuel and recover from your training, says Rancourt.

First things first: If you have any medical concerns, talk to your doctor before you begin walking or running, especially if you have joint or muscle issues, Pelc Graca says. If that's the case, your doctor may recommend a brace to wear while exercising or a set of specific stretches to supplement your walks or runs, she adds.
Running shoes
are also key for your health to help you run or walk with proper form and reduce the risk of injury, says Pelc Graca.  "I recommend visiting a running store to get properly fitted for running shoes, because often times, the store professionals will look at the shape of your feet and perhaps even your running form using a treadmill to recommend the best running shoe for you," she explains. "Not all running shoes are best for all people."
Finally, remember that consistency is key for weight loss. "Aim for consistency in your walks and runs, rather than intensity at the beginning," says Pelc Graca. "Building a habit of regular exercise will contribute to long-term success."

Why Trust Us?
Want to start running? You'll be in good company, considering almost 60 million Americans regularly hit the road, trail, or tread, according to
Statista research
.
The benefits are pretty legit, too, considering even just 10 minutes of leisurely running per day can help you live longer, found one 2014
Journal of the American College of Cardiology
study. (
Some research
, published in
ScienceDirect
, actually suggests runners live a full
three years
longer than non-runners, if you needed extra convincing.) Plus, pounding the pavement also just makes you feel
good

20 Functional Core Exercises That Aren’t Crunches
"Almost every time you go out there, you can accomplish something new," says
Carl Leivers
, a USA Track & Field Certified Level 2 endurance coach based in Atlanta. Anything from running for an extra minute, to tackling a hill without stopping, or just having a more positive attitude while you're hoofing it counts—and you can’t beat the high of crossing your first finish line or setting a new PR.
Though running is one of the most accessible forms of exercise out there, becoming a runner can be a little more complicated than just lacing up and putting one foot in front of the other. (Unless you don't care about burning lungs, aching legs, and shin splints, that is.)
Whether you've never run a full mile, want to finish your first 5k, or are ready to train for a half-marathon, these training, fueling, and injury-prevention tips will make you a better runner than ever—and yes, even help you enjoy every step.
1. Don’t be afraid to start with walking.
If you’ve never laced up your sneaks for a run before, ease into a consistent cardio routine by
walking for about 20 minutes, three times a week
, says Colleen M. Brough, DPT, director of the Columbia University RunLab.
From there,
progress your walks into run-walk interval workouts
, Brough recommends. Start with 20 minutes four times a week, then bump the time up to 30 to 35 minutes.
“Run-walk intervals help minimize the risk of injury and can make the process of starting out more enjoyable and less daunting,” says Megan Roche, MD, running coach for
Strava
. “Increasing the number and duration of running intervals versus walking intervals is a great way to progress over time.”
If you’re starting out with those 20-minute workouts, for example, alternate between running for 30 seconds and walking for 90 seconds.
As you get more comfortable, alternate between 60 seconds of running and walking—and eventually work your way up to a non-stop run.
2. Use your breath to find your pace.
Sure, you might know
how
to run, but knowing what kind of pace you can hold is a whole other story.
New runners almost always start running too fast and then burn out, says Brandon T. Vallair, USA Track & Field Certified Level 1 Coach and owner of
Run for Speed
in Dallas.
"The idea is to finish each run wanting to do a little bit more or go a little bit faster."
Though you might associate the word "running" with
speed
, give yourself permission to slow it down.
To control your tempo, use the “talk test” and
maintain a speed at which you can easily converse or sing
, suggests Vallair. If you're gasping for breath, slow down. If you can belt out the chorus to a Bruno Mars song on your iPod, pick it up a bit.
"The idea is to finish each run wanting to do a little bit more or go a little bit faster," says Leivers. "It makes it easier to get out there the next time, because you feel like there's more to accomplish."
Even if you follow these guidelines, though, know that running will still likely feel a little uncomfortable at first. “Newbie runners should keep in mind that, when they start their run, their whole body has to play catch-up and it can feel pretty bad for the first stretch,” says Brough. “It gets better!”
3. Don't run every day.
It's true that practice and repetition are key for fitness success. Each run you do stresses your muscles, bones, joints, and ligaments, forcing them to adapt by growing stronger and more efficient.
You can totally do too much of a good thing, though. Pounding the pavement is high-impact and repetitive, so going overboard can increase your injury risk.
The trick is to find the sweet spot in which you run enough to spark changes but also give your body enough time to recover. "There is a delicate balance, and you have to find the formula that works for you," says RRCA-certified run coach Jennifer Gill, CPT.
Start out with three runs per week
, Gill recommends. Any less and you may not progress as quickly as you'd like; any more, though, and you may not have time to recover.
Once you've logged six weeks of three weekly runs, you can add a fourth running day
, says Leivers. This allows you to keep up the consistency without overloading your body.
4. Focus on minutes instead of miles.
How you measure your runs is totally up to you, but thinking in time instead of distance may be less daunting.
After all, setting out to run for 30 minutes gives you more wiggle room to have a bad day or take it slow than vowing to run three miles.
Tight glutes messing with your run game? Incorporate this stretch into your routine:
“In general,
I like people who are just getting into running to
run by duration of time as opposed to mileage
, unless they are training for a specific racing goal," Roche says. "I find focusing on duration helps with consistency and avoids a focus on pace.”
After all, you want to keep getting back out there, not feel discouraged or overworked. Forgetting about mileage means you can focus on feeling good throughout your run.
5. Progress smartly and safely.
If you have your eyes set on a race (especially a half-marathon or longer), you'll (of course!) need to dial up your distance. However, it's key to do so slowly.
First,
designate just
one
run each week as your long run
, says Leivers. While you can add a  mile or two to that run over time, keep the rest of your runs the same.
Leivers's number-one rule: Increase your total weekly mileage every other week by no more than the number of days per week you run. For instance, if you run three days a week, you can increase your mileage by three miles every other week.
And number two: Keep your long run to no more than half your weekly total mileage to prevent overdoing it during any single outing. So, if you run 10 miles a week, that long run should be five miles or less.
6. Mix up your runs.
Once you can run for about 30 minutes straight, you can start adding intervals—which will help you improve your overall pace by switching up the stimulus on your body—to your routine, says Brough.
Plus, “switching up workouts is a great way to keep the fun rolling," says Roche.
Two ways to try intervals:
Hill strides:
Run uphill for 20 to 30 seconds, then jog downhill or on flat road until recovered.
Speed intervals:
Alternate between one minute at about 75-percent effort and one  minute of easy jogging.
Sprint intervals:
Alternate between one minute of all-out sprinting and five minutes of easy jogging.
You can also use checkpoints (like mailboxes, trees, or houses) as interval endpoints to keep outdoor runs interesting, Roche says.
7. When in doubt, find a training plan.
If you’re starting to run with the ultimate goal of completing a race, the right training plan will help you get there.
Totally new to the running thing? Try a
couch-to-5K plan
.
“It feels mentally good to have a plan and a goal—and it’ll help you build volume appropriately," says Roche. "You’ll be less likely to have to interrupt your running routine or training because of an injury.”
Once you've found a plan that suits your goals, adapt it to your daily life, Roche says. If you have a big commitment one week and won’t be able to run, for example, adjust the next week’s schedule to accommodate.
8. Gear up to go the distance.
If there's one piece of equipment you need to successfully become a runner, it's a pair of
comfortable running shoes
.
“Running shoe preference is something that varies widely across individuals—a shoe that may work well for one runner may cause issues in another,” Roche says. To find your perfect pair, check out a local run shop to try out a few pairs of running shoes and see what feels best on your feet.
Though
it's important to find a pair of shoes suited to your foot mechanics, comfort is still top priority
, adds Brough.

From there, consider stocking up on some moisture-wicking tops (skip anything cotton), says Brough.
If you want to record your stats or run routes, a
fitness tracker
can help you get into the nitty gritty of your new hobby.
9. Call in the accountability buddies.
One surefire way to keep up with your running workouts—and an easy way to make them more enjoyable and more social—is to join a running group, or at least find a running pal.
You don’t always have to meet with these accountability buddies in person, either. Online platforms and
running apps
—including Strava, Nike Run Club, and MapMyRun—offer virtual support groups to cheer you on and motivate you to get moving and log those miles.
10. Remember why you’re out there.
Runners hit the road (or tread) for all sorts of  reasons—some for fitness and health, others for mindfulness, to be social, or for the competition, shows a
survey done by Strava
.
To keep your love of running alive, remember what made you want to pound the pavement in the first place.
“As your running experience grows, running will mean different things to you, and you will transition through being different runners,” says Brough.
Whether your motivation is to finish a 5k, escape work stress, or catch up with a friend, “enjoyment comes from finding your why, and going for it,” Brough says. Define yours, then get out there!

So there you are, settling into your stride about halfway through a
run
, when a sudden
pain
punches you square in the chest. As the feeling tightens, you clutch your collar in a panic. Is it a totally random
heart attack
? Well, don’t race to conclusions just yet. Although experiencing chest pain while running is downright frightening, they could be signaling a number of issues that run the gamut from serious to not so scary.

20 Functional Core Exercises That Aren’t Crunches
“
Chest pain
that occurs while running may have a variety of causes,” says
David Friedman
, M.D., chief of heart failure services at Long Island Jewish Valley Stream Hospital. “While it’s important not to ignore pain, not all chest pain while running is cause for concern.”
Chest pain or chest pressure  during exercise  can occur in recreational runners, as well as in athletes who are in  excellent shape, says Jennifer Mieres, M.D., professor of cardiology at the Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra. "There are many possible causes which span the spectrum from  benign to life threatening, so it's important  for everyone who exercises to be able to  recognize the signs and  symptoms that  indicate when chest pain or pressure during a run is a marker of a potentially serious issue such as heart disease or asthma."
Ok, noted. In order from least to most severe, here are the five most common reasons why your chest could hurt during a run, plus what to do if you think you're experiencing them.
1. You’re new to running
Jumping in to a
new jogging routine
can be physically taxing—especially when you’re a rookie. If you haven’t had much training in the sport, it could be that you’re working out at a rate or intensity that your body isn’t accustomed to yet.

“You need to back off and be more realistic about what you’re trying to accomplish,” says Janet Hamilton, CSCS., exercise physiologist, and lead running coach for
Running Strong
in Atlanta. She suggests warming up with a walk, then easing your way into a relaxed running pace. “If you can recite the pledge of allegiance as you’re running, then you’re probably running at the right effort,” she says. “If you’re having a hard time chatting, slow down.”
Heavy respiration during a run may be painful at first, but the strain typically goes away with
consistent practice
. Also, it goes without saying that any new workout regimen you’re considering should be cleared by your doctor first.
2. The muscles in your chest are cramping
Just like the muscles in your legs, the muscles surrounding your rib cage (called “
intercostal muscles
”) are also prone to
cramping
while you’re pounding the pavement. This sharp pain is highly localized—meaning you can usually put a finger on exactly where it hurts—and might worsen with movement. According to Friedman,
dehydration
or electrolyte depletion could be the culprits behind the spasms.

Since there’s not much you can do to strengthen your intercostal muscles anyway, try refueling with some water and changing up your breathing pattern. “If you tend to breathe on a symmetrical rhythm (for example, in for two steps, out for two), you may want to play with breathing in an asymmetrical rhythm (inhale for two steps, exhale for three) so that you’re constantly switching which leg is in weight-bearing position when breathing is initiated,” says Hamilton.
3. You have heartburn
You may not realize it, but jogging piles a ton of pressure on to your
digestive system
. For one thing, Dr. Friedman explains, the increased tension within the abdomen causes the esophageal sphincter (the muscle at the bottom of the esophagus that keeps your stomach contents from rising into your throat) to relax, contributing to heartburn.
To ease the sensation and keep your food in your stomach where it belongs, he advises forgoing heavy meals before runs. If you do eat prior to hitting the road, stay away from trigger foods—that is, anything spicy, fried, or caffeinated. “You may also want to monitor the foods you consume before runs to determine if a particular food doesn’t sit well with you,” says Hamilton. “If you’re
burping
if you run after eating a banana, then switch to something else as your
pre-run snack
.”
4. You have an unaddressed lung condition, like asthma
Here’s where things get dicey. There are a few different pulmonary issues that can spark pain during a sprint, the most common of which is
asthma
. Pre-workout medication can help prevent an exercise-induced asthma attack, and a rescue inhaler should always be kept on hand during a run if you’re a diagnosed
asthmatic
. “If you don’t quickly respond to your inhaler, this could signify worsening breathing mechanics and the need for urgent care,” says Dr. Friedman. Stop  running, and if you do not get relief within a few minutes,  and have symptoms of shortness of breath and wheezing, consult your doctor, notes Dr. Mieres. If symptoms progress, call 911.

6 Tips for Runners with Asthma
Other dangerous—but less common—causes include pneumothorax (a leakage of air into the space between the lungs and the chest wall) and
pulmonary embolism
(a blood clot in an artery supplying the lungs). Both of these are often paired with a sudden onset of severe pain and shortness of breath, which doesn’t go away with rest. If you see these red flags, don’t ignore them; get the help of a doctor right away.
5. You’re having heart complications, like heart disease, heart attack, or angina
Now for the worst-case scenario. You already know that the harder you run, the harder your heart has to work. But if your coronary arteries—which bring blood to your ticker—contract, the insufficient blood supply can induce chest pain when you exercise. This condition is known as “
angina
,” and should resolve after a few minutes of rest (though you should definitely still follow up with your doc, says Dr. Mieres).

5 Subtle Symptoms Of Heart Disease
And, of course, physical strain can also prompt a heart attack (an acute blockage of a coronary artery) or an arterial tear. Accelerating and worsening chest pain, pain in the jaw, back, left arm or other parts of the upper body, heavy sweating, nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, significant palpitations, and/or dizziness that worsens with high-intensity activity but is relieved with rest are all signs of a heart attack, Dr. Friedman adds. Call 911 right away if you experience these symptoms.
If you have even the slightest suspicion that your heart isn’t ticking quite right, the best thing to do is book it straight to your physician’s office. “When in doubt, go get checked out! The worst you’ll experience is some expense and some embarrassment if it turns out it was nothing life-threatening,” says Hamilton. “If it was something serious, you may have just saved your own life.”

Why Trust Us?
If
foam rolling
has ever seemed like one of those extra steps best left to naturally limber yogis or die-hard marathoners, let’s clear that up right now. At its core, foam rolling is a type of
self-myofascial release
(SMR), which sounds fancy but basically means giving your muscles and connective tissues a deep, pressure-based, DIY massage (yes, please!).
While everything about how it works hasn’t been determined through science just yet, what we do know is that foam rolling is a simple, affordable way to help you feel—and move—better, says Winnie Yu, DPT, CPT, a doctor of physical therapy and personal trainer. Aside from frequent, multidirectional movement (meaning regular exercise and
stretching
) foam rolling is the next-best thing you can do to “loosen up,” promote
muscle recovery
, and support better
mobility
, says Jessa Zinn, a board-certified structural integrator, fascia release expert, and soft tissue therapist. Plus, it’s a great excuse to sneak in some quiet time on your mat pre- or post-workout, and can be done just about anywhere.
Not sure where to start in your foam rolling practice? Let’s chat through what foam rolling actually does, who can benefit from it the most, and how to make it part of your routine—regardless of how you like to get moving.
Meet the experts:
Winnie Yu
, DPT, CPT, is a doctor of physical therapy at
Bespoke Treatments
in New York City.
Jessa Zinn
, SIP, is a NYC-based, board-certified structural integrator, fascia expert, and therapist who works with top athletes including Peloton instructors. She is the owner of
The Fascia Lab
, an online platform offering guided, science-based fascia release techniques.
Foam rolling helps your fascia "chill out."
Fascia
is the connective tissue that wraps around your muscles and organs. Imagine it like a thin, stretchy spiderweb all over the inside of your body, says Zinn.
For years, people assumed fascia was just a supportive structure, like packing material for your organs. But
newer research
shows it’s actually much more dynamic: Fascia can tighten or loosen, much like a muscle, thanks to special cells called
myofibroblasts
.
These special cells can cause tightness in specific areas, contributing to stiffness, pain, or that "locked up" feeling. When fascia becomes overly tight, it can throw off your body’s coordination and how muscles work together, and just feel plain, well,
bad.
The compression from foam rolling applies pressure to those areas, helping relax the fascia and release some of that tension by supporting fluid circulation within your tissue, according to
a 2024 systematic review in
BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders
.
“When you foam roll, you’re essentially ‘squeezing the sponge’ of your fascia, encouraging fluid to move through its layers,” says Zinn. Rolling, along with regular exercise and stretching, keeps this tissue hydrated and flexible so that you can move smoother and freer, according to
a 2022 meta-analysis published in
Sports Medicine
. Similarly,
a 2020 study in
PLOS One
shows that fascia responds to mechanical stress—like the compression from foam rolling—by enhancing fluid flow through its collagen fibers. Think of it as ironing out the wrinkles in your tissue for a smoother, less "bunched-up feeling,” says Zinn.

Improves flexibility and mobility
by loosening up tight spots and reducing stiffness in the fascia.
Reduces tension-related pain
by releasing tightness in overworked muscles and breaking up adhesions (A.K.A. “knots”) in connective tissue.
Lessens muscle soreness
following exercise, meaning you’ll feel less stiff the next day and be ready for your next sweat session.
Boosts circulation
by stimulating blood flow, which delivers oxygen and nutrients to your muscles.
Just about anyone can benefit from rolling regularly.
Foam rolling is one of those things that can benefit just about everyone. For everyday folks, it’s a great way to ease tightness and boost mobility. And if you’re into fitness, whether you’re just starting out or have been hitting the gym for years, foam rolling can also be a game-changer for recovery. In fact, just a few minutes of rolling post-workout can reduce
delayed-onset muscle soreness
(that next-day
ouch
after a tough workout), according to
a 2024 study in the
Journal of Bodywork and Movement Therapies
.
It’s great for older adults, too. As we age, fascia gets tighter and less hydrated, which can limit mobility. Foam rolling is a solid way to help keep things flexible and maintain range of motion as you get older, according to
a 2021 study in the
International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health
.
That said, foam rolling isn’t for everyone. If you’re dealing with an injury,
chronic pain
, or extreme soreness, it’s smart to check in with a physical therapist first. It’s always better to be safe and get the green light from a pro.
How To Choose (And Use!) A Foam Roller
First things first: Not all foam rollers are the same. They come in various densities (soft, medium, firm) and sizes, so choosing the right one depends on your goals. Softer rollers are best for beginners or anyone with super sore muscles, while firmer ones provide deeper pressure for serious knot-busting, says Zinn.
To get started:
Pick your spot.
Focus on large muscle groups like
quads
,
hamstrings
,
calves
,
glutes
, and
back
(more on this below).
Roll
sloooowly
.
Move over each muscle for about 30 seconds to a minute, pausing on any particularly tender spots.
Check your pressure.
Keep your movements controlled, and use your hands or feet to adjust how much weight you’re putting on the roller.
For newbies, try a few minutes of foam rolling after workouts to aid recovery. It can also be a helpful pre-workout to warm up muscles and improve blood flow, says Yu, so it’s a good idea to test out rolling before and after exercise to find a routine that works for you. You can also make it a quick morning or evening self-care ritual to release tension and combat tightness from sitting all day.
Pro tip
: A little discomfort is normal, but if it feels more
ow
than
ahh
, switch to a softer roller or adjust your technique—foam rolling should feel intense but not unbearable.

For those of us who prioritize
daily activity
yet spend long days in primarily sedentary postures, keeping your frame ache-free can be a serious challenge. One major pain point for serial hunched-over desk job workers is the
shoulder
joint. Good news: The best shoulder stretches can be done anywhere, whether they’re integrated in your pre-workout warmup or in bite-sized sessions at your desk throughout the day.
Poor posture throughout the day, like when sitting at a desk, puts stress on the neck and shoulder joint, says Sabrina M. Strickland, MD, an orthopedic surgeon and sports medicine doctor at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York City. On top of adding shoulder and
core strengthening
exercises into your workouts, prioritizing stretching can help combat stiffness, she says.
You may have the
strengthening part
covered in your sweat sessions, but stretching often gets overlooked as a key component of a well-rounded fitness regimen. While cross-training (engaging in a variety of training modalities, such as a combo of strength training and running vs. just one), yoga, and functional strength training can help offset shoulder pain, incorporating shoulder stretches into your daily routine is key for overall and long-term shoulder health.  That’s why in collaboration with Dr. Strickland and Roser, we're offering up our favorite shoulder stretches to promote healthy, mobile, and strong shoulders.
Meet the experts:
Sabrina M. Strickland
, MD, is an orthopedic surgeon and sports medicine doctor at the
Hospital for Special Surgery
in New York City.
Holly Roser
, CPT, is a trainer, sports nutritionist, and the owner of
Holly Roser Fitness
in San Mateo, CA.
Rachel Tavel
, DPT, CSCS, is a doctor of physical therapy and strength and conditioning specialist.
Benefits Of Shoulder Stretches
Shoulder stretches are essential for keeping your shoulders flexible, reducing tightness, preventing injury, and making up for deficits caused by overuse or poor mechanics, especially as you get older, says Dr. Strickland. “Since stretching can help you maintain your mobility, it’s an important piece of aging healthfully and promoting longevity,” says Rachel Tavel, DPT, CSCS, a physical therapist and strength and conditioning specialist. Over time, shoulder mobility tends to decrease, but regular stretching can help you maintain your range of motion, making it easier to stay active and feel good in your daily life, according to a 2022
study
in
JSES International
.
How To Perform Shoulder Stretches Safely
When it comes to any new stretching routine, it’s important to stay within
your
comfort zone. Always stretch within your available range of motion—meaning you don’t need to achieve the full expression of each move right away. Instead, start by moving through a pain-free range to explore your current mobility, and as you become more comfortable, gradually deepen your stretch. For those who don’t stretch or exercise frequently, it’s best to start with shoulder stretches two to three times a week to build up mobility.
If you’re more active, you can incorporate these stretches into your routine five to six times a week. Since these are mobility exercises, you can perform them regularly without much risk of injury, as long as you maintain proper form and respect your body's limits.
Important note:
If you’re dealing with shoulder pain or have experienced shoulder issues in the past, it's a good idea to consult a doctor or physical therapist before adopting these stretches in your routine. Your healthcare provider can help rule out any underlying issues that may require specific treatment and offer guidance on which stretches are or are not safe for you.
Time
: 10 minutes |
Equipment
: Foam roller (optional) |
Good for
: Shoulders, chest, upper back
Instructions:
Choose 4 to 6 shoulder stretches from the list. Perform each one for the duration or number of reps indicated below, repeating on the opposite side when applicable. Once you've completed one round of stretches, repeat the cycle for a total of four rounds. Keep in mind that static stretching before exercise can increase your risk of injury, says Roser. So, if you’re stretching as part of your warmup, we recommend sticking to the dynamic stretches listed below.
Knowledge boost:
Static stretching refers to holding a position isometrically for a given duration, while dynamic stretching refers to fluidly moving in and out of the stretched position for a given duration or number of reps, taking a joint through its range of motion.
Best Shoulder Stretches
1. Arm Circles
Type:
Dynamic
How to:
Stand with feet hip-width apart, arms extended out to sides.
Keeping shoulders down and core engaged, bring arms up and around in medium-sized circles.
After about 30 seconds, reverse the direction.
That’s 1 set.
2. TYW
Type:
Dynamic
How to:
Start standing with feet hip-width apart, then hinge at the hips to bring your torso slightly forward. Maintain a straight back. Extend arms out to sides to form a T shape.
Maintaining your body position, swing the arms up so the upper arms align with the ears, forming a Y shape.
Core engaged the entire time, bend elbows to waist and retract the shoulder blades to form a W shape.
Continue repeating the sequence for 30 to 60 seconds.
That’s 1 set.
3. Child’s Pose
Type:
Static
How to:
Start in a kneeling position, with shins flat on the ground.
Rest your butt on your heels, knees slightly wider than torso, and hands in lap.
Walk your arms out on floor to extend in front of you.
Lower stomach down onto thighs, and rest forehead on floor. Hold the position  for at least 60 seconds.
That’s 1 set.
4. Thread The Needle
Type:
Static or dynamic
How to:
Begin on all fours.
Lift your right arm up towards the ceiling while keeping your gaze on your hand as you move.
Lower right arm to ‘thread the needle’ in between your left hand and left knee, dropping your right shoulder towards the ground and resting the right arm on the ground.
For static stretching, hold this position for 30 to 60 seconds, then repeat on the other side. That’s 1 set. For a dynamic version of this stretch, alternate between lifting your arm towards the ceiling and ‘threading the needle’ for 10 to 15 reps on each side.
That’s 1 set.
5. Overhead Triceps Stretch
Type:
Static
How to:
Stand tall with arms relaxed by sides.
Raise right arm straight up.
Bend right arm and place right palm behind head.
Place left hand on right elbow and gently draw right arm back and over toward the left. Stop when you feel a stretch in the back of right arm.
Hold for 30 seconds, then repeat on the opposite side.
That’s 1 set.
Pro tip:
To optimize the benefits of this stretch, maintain an upright position with your head rather than allowing it to drop forward.
6. Arm Swings
Type:
Dynamic
How to:
Stand with feet about hip-width apart and arms relaxed at sides. Raise arms up to shoulder height.
Swing both arms forward so they cross in front of you.
Swing both arms backwards so they open up behind you.
That’s 1 rep.
Continue for 10 to 15 reps or 30 to 60 seconds, keeping your movements fluid and controlled, avoiding any sudden or jerky movements.
Pro tip:
Start with a smaller range of motion, then gradually increase the speed and range as you warm up.
7. Behind-The-Back Stretch
Type:
Static
How to:
Stand tall with feet hip-width apart and arms relaxed by sides.
Clasp hands behind back so that your fingers are interlocked.
With hands clasped, let shoulder blades come together and try to reach hands toward the wall behind you. You should feel a stretch in the shoulders and chest. Hold this stretch for 30 to 60 seconds. Repeat 2-3 times.
That’s 1 set.
8. Open Books
Type:
Dynamic
How to:
Start by lying on right side with knees bent and head resting on right arm, a pillow or a yoga block. Your arms should be straight out in front of you with palms facing each other.
Begin by lifting your top (left) arm up and allowing it to reach toward the ceiling then to your left, like you’re opening a book. Simultaneously turn head to follow your left hand until you are looking to the left side. Keep hips facing toward the right.
When you get to the “open book” position, hold for about 5 seconds, breathing deeply and focusing on the stretch in the front of the top shoulder.
Return to the starting position.
That’s 1 rep.
Repeat the stretch for 10 to 15 reps, then switch sides.
9. Cross-Body Stretch
Type:
Static
How to:
Stand with feet shoulder-width apart facing forward.
Keeping the left arm straight, extend it directly across chest. Use right forearm arm to gently pull the left arm into your body.

That’s 1 set.
Pro tip:
Keep your shoulders relaxed and avoid hunching them toward your ears.
10. Downward Dog
Type:
Static or dynamic
How to:
Start on all fours.
Tuck toes and lift hips into air, extending legs to straight and shifting weight back into feet so body forms an upside down "V" shape.
Hold isometrically or pedal through your feet for about 60 seconds.
That’s 1 set.
Pro tip:
If you're experiencing tightness in the hamstrings or lower back, lift your heels and softly bend your knees to modify. If your shoulders are hurting, try moving your hands wider apart or rotating your hands outwards by about 45-degrees.
11. Supine Pec Stretch
Type:
Dynamic
How to:
Lie on back with knees bent, feet flat on the ground, and a foam roller under you, down the length of your spine with head resting on it.
Lift arms straight up toward the ceiling with palms facing each other.
Open arms horizontally into a T position until your hands rest on the floor with palms facing up. (If you don’t have the flexibility to have them rest on the floor, it’s okay for them to hover over the floor.)
Hold for 30-60 seconds, allowing gravity to increase the stretch. You should feel a gentle stretch in your chest, biceps, and the front of your shoulders. Repeat 2-3 times.
That’s 1 set.
What causes shoulder tightness?
Shoulder tightness is often caused by poor posture, especially from slouching or hunching over when sitting for extended periods of time. It can also result from stress, which makes you tense up your muscles (commonly in the trapezius muscles), or from overworking the shoulder muscles during exercise. Lack of movement and long periods of inactivity can also contribute to stiffness in the shoulders and upper back, making it important to stay active by incorporating stretching throughout the day.
Of course, shoulder pain can also stem from overworking the joint. Athletes—particularly those who repetitively throw or swing items, like baseballs, golf clubs, or tennis rackets—are most prone to tightness and pain, says Dr. Strickland.
How To Prevent Shoulder Tightness
To prevent shoulder tightness, focus on maintaining good posture, especially if you sit at a desk, drive a lot, or look down at your phone or computer often. Incorporating regular shoulder stretches and exercises into your routine is a great way to keep the muscles flexible and strong, says Roser. Take breaks throughout the day to move around when sitting for long hours, and if you’re into lifting weights, balance your workouts with proper warmups, cooldowns, and avoid overloading your shoulders with heavy weights too quickly to prevent hindering mobility.

If you spend a lot of time
sitting
(I'm talking to you, fellow desk-job-workers), your body, and more specifically, your hips, are probably aching to be stretched.  One of the best ways to soothe tight hips (and your lower back) is simple, though: Give them a good stretch.
“Anything you do often, you get really good at. So, individuals who sit down for long periods of time get really good at holding that position,” says Colette Nguyen, CPT, trainer at Soho Strength Lab. “As a byproduct, the hip flexors get tight, glutes get elongated, and hips end up getting weak as a result.” If tightness in your hips goes unchecked, it's common to experience lower back pain or tightness in your knees.

Benefits Of Hip Stretches
Even if you don’t sit all day, chances are you could benefit from doing hip stretches on the regular. Hip stretches can relieve tightness in the hip flexors, which is common from both sitting and standing for long periods. This relief isn’t confined to the hips—stretching the hip joint can also alleviate lower back pain and discomfort in other areas connected to tight hips, says Nguyen. Improved flexibility from these stretches can also enhance your posture, helping you maintain a more aligned and comfortable stance throughout the day. Plus, the more limber and mobile your hips are, the easier and more efficient everyday activities like walking, bending, and lifting can become.
Stretching can also promote relaxation and reduce stress, offering a simple way to unwind and give your body and mind a little TLC. When you stretch, it not only relieves tension in tight muscles but also encourages the release of endorphins, which are natural mood lifters.
Beyond flexibility, building strength in your hips is super important for preventing future hip pain and ensuring long-term joint health, according to Nguyen. Combining regular stretching with
strength-building exercises
to support the hip joint is key to maintaining healthy, pain-free hips in the long run.
How To Stretch Your Hips At Home
Below, trainers share their favorite moves to stretch the hips. These stretches can be performed on their own, or  incorporated into your workout routine as a warmup or cooldown, says Yami Mufdi, CPT. You can also string a few of the moves below together for quick stretch breaks throughout the day.
Time:
5 minutes |
Equipment:
None |
Good for:
Hips
Instructions:
Choose any three hip stretches from the list below. Perform each stretch for at least 30 seconds, repeat on the opposite side, if applicable, then continue to the next stretch. Once you've completed three stretches, repeat the cycle twice more for a total of three hip-opening rounds.
Pro tip:
If you want to stretch your hips before a workout, Mufdi recommends first starting with a warmup that includes cardio to get your heart rate up, followed by a few
dynamic stretches
. For those who prefer to stretch it out after sweating it out, choose a few static stretches to thank your muscles and hip joints for working for you.
1
High Lunge

Return hands to the floor and step your left foot forward to meet your right foot.
Step the right foot back to repeat on the other side.
That's 1 round.
Pro tip:
Keep your hips squared to the front.
2
Hip Rotations
Targets:
hip abductors, glutes, quads, psoas, core
Why it rocks:

Open legs like a book, bring soles of feet together, and grasp toes.
Push knees down toward the mat and reach your chest forward slightly.
That's 1 round.
Pro tip:
Move your heels closer toward your body for a deeper stretch or further away from you for an easier one.
10
Hip Flexor Rainbow
Targets:
hip flexors
Why it rocks:
This move takes the hip flexor stretch a step further by adding some rotation to get deeper into the hip flexor.
How to:
Start in a half-kneeling position with left foot forward and right leg back with right knee, shin, and foot flat on mat.
Press hips forward slightly, rest right hand on left thigh, and reach left arm straight out in front of you.

11
Couch Stretch
Targets:
glutes, hamstrings, knee flexors
Why it rocks:
This is a great stretch to get deeper into the opening of the hip flexor, says Lampa.
How to:
Set up in front of a bench (or your couch). Bring your left leg to a low lunge position and bring your right foot to rest on the bench (toes pointing up) with your knee resting on a pad or rolled up mat. Place your hands on your hips.
Squeeze your right glute, then release and repeat on the other side.
That's 1 round.
12
Glute Push-Through
Targets:
glutes
Why it rocks:
This micro-movement may not look like much, but it’s one of the best ways to get a deep stretch in the hip flexors. It can be done standing just about anywhere—try it in the airport security line, waiting for the train, at the office—you name it.
How to:
Start standing with your left foot forward, right leg about a foot back.
Push up onto your left toe while simultaneously pushing your toe hard into the ground as you tuck your pelvis while squeezing your left glute on and off.
Release and repeat on the other side.
That's 1 round.
Pro tip:
Your feet should be on “railroad tracks” with your hips facing straight ahead.

Frog
Targets:
inner thighs, hips
Why it rocks:
The frog stretch is excellent for preparing the body for squats and other lower-body exercises that require significant range of motion in the hip joint.
How to:
Get into a frog position with your knees separated as far apart as is comfortable, resting on your forearms and shins, knees, and ankles.
Squeeze the right glute to activate the stretch in the right hip first. Release and repeat on the left side.
That's 1 round.
14
Pretzel
Targets:
hips, spine, core
Why it rocks:
The pretzel gets deep into the glutes, hip flexors, quads, and spine all at the same time—talk about efficiency!
How to:
Lay flat on your back with one leg extended long and the other bent.
Pull your bent leg across your body at a 90 degree angle with your opposite arm helping to press that knee to the floor.
Then, use your other hand to pull your extended leg back toward your quad forming a 45 degree angle.
Repeat on the other side.
Pro tip:
Keep your shoulders flat on the floor.

90-90 Hip Switches
Targets:
hip flexors, glutes, external rotators
Why it rocks:
This stretch boosts mobility, eases muscle tension, and helps prevent injuries in your hips and lower back.
How to:
Sit on the floor with your with arms extended behind you for support, knees bent and feet flat on the ground.
Rotate your right leg so that your right shin is in front of you, making a 90-degree angle between your right thigh and calf.
Rotate your left leg so that your left shin is beside you, also making a 90-degree angle between your left thigh and calf. Your left knee should be in line with your left hip.
Sitting tall with your spine straight, flip each leg to the opposite side. Place your hands on the ground for support if needed.
Continue alternating for 30 seconds.
That's 1 round.
16
Half Kneeling Abductor Rock
Targets:
hips, inner thighs
Why it rocks:
This dynamic unilateral stretch helps address mobility imbalances between your right and left hip.
How to:
Get into a kneeling stance with one leg extended out to the side.
Lean forward into your bended knee.
Repeat on the other side.
That's 1 round.

17
Supine Figure 4
Targets:
hips, glutes, hamstrings
Why it rocks:
This is a “must do” move for a deep release in the glutes, according to Lampa.
How to:
Laying flat on your back with knees bent, cross one leg over the other to create a 4.
Then, reach through to pull your uncrossed leg closer to your body.
Repeat on the other side.
That's 1 round.
Pro tip:
You can also do this stretch seated or rock your legs back and forth in windshield wipers to get a deeper stretch.

5 Beginner Mat Pilates Exercises To Try
Created by German boxer, self-defense instructor, and circus performer Joseph Pilates in the early 1900s, Pilates (originally called Contrology) is a system of movement with strengthening and stretching at its core. Interestingly, the term “Pilates” is not trademarked: A
2000 court ruling determined it was a generic name
, like yoga. So over the ensuing years, the Pilates name has been co-opted and commandeered to describe a host of modalities that emphasize the core and precise, controlled movements. Meaning that “Pilates” has gotten muddled over the years.
But, as any Pilates purist will tell you, the heart of classical Pilates lies in the system created by Pilates himself. And at the heart of that system, is the matwork. (Sorry, reformer!)
“Mat is the foundation of the Pilates method,” says Carrie Campbell, a Pilates instructor in Hoboken, New Jersey. “Pilates was born on the mat first, and then Mr. Pilates realized that the exercises are very challenging and people needed assistance, so then he built the equipment. Today, a lot of people think we need this fancy equipment to do Pilates, but Pilates can be done anywhere, anytime with a mat or a towel because most of the foundational core-strengthening exercises are from the matwork.”
Pilates actually outlined his movement philosophy and original 34 mat exercises (including photos of a bare- and barrel-chested Pilates!) in his 1945 book
Return to Life Through Contrology
.
“All of the exercises are there for a specific reason, one flows seamlessly into the next,” says Tracy Belcher, a Pilates instructor in Miami, of the matwork. “Really, the goal is to return your body to its factory settings of when we were bouncy little children running and playing and hopping and climbing and doing all these things pain-free, moving through life with zest and pleasure.”
Sounds pretty good, huh? If you’re ready to get a bit of your zest back and get started with mat Pilates, here’s everything you need to know in a handy beginner’s guide.

Benefits Of Mat Pilates—And Who It’s Best For
It’s hard to mention the word “Pilates” without the word “core” escaping in the next breath, but that’s not all Pilates is about, according to Belcher.
“One of the myths about Pilates is that it's a core workout,” she says. “In actuality, it’s a full-body workout. We do focus a lot on the core because you're moving from your center, flowing out. Your core is going to become strong, but the rest of your body will become strong too.”

And strength is only one of the many benefits of incorporating Pilates into your movement regimen. With its “strengthening through stretching” exercises, the method allows many people to increase their flexibility and range of motion. Posture often improves with Pilates too—as the muscles of your core become stronger, you may find yourself able to sit or stand up straighter; as you stretch the muscles in your shoulders and chest, you may find yourself less hunched or rounded forward. Pilates may also help alleviate chronic aches and pains: In a
2021 meta analysis
, Pilates was found to help relieve lower back pain better than other singularly focused workouts (think: aerobics, general strengthening).
Pilates is also a great companion exercise to other physical pursuits, says Campbell. “It complements pretty much anything else you want to do in life,” she says. “If you want to be better at boxing, go to Pilates. If you want to be better at golf or tennis, go to Pilates. If you want to be better at carrying your load of laundry to the basement, go to Pilates.”
Given that it’s a low-impact exercise that primarily takes place in supine and seated positions, mat Pilates is an accessible workout for most people.
“As long as you are cleared by a doctor to work out, then you can do Pilates,” Belcher says. “Every age, every ability—there's a class out there for everybody.” (For folks who are prenatal, postpartum, or have a chronic injury or condition, it’s important to let your instructor know so they can offer you modifications and guide you safely through exercises, as some might be contraindicated for your condition.)

How Mat Pilates Differs From Other Types Of Workouts
Hot Pilates. Wall Pilates. Yogilates. With the method being reimagined in so many new forms and blended with so many other exercises, it can be a little confusing to delineate mat Pilates from similar workouts that incorporate mats, mindful movement, and stretching. Here’s how to tell them all apart:
Mat Pilates vs. yoga:
A mat Pilates class and a yoga class both take place on a mat and incorporate various stretching exercises, but that’s really where the similarities end, Belcher notes. “Working from the center is one of the distinguishable things about Pilates versus yoga,” she says. “In Pilates, you're really focused on what we call the ‘powerhouse,’ and that's the muscles at where your center of gravity is, basically working from there out.” Even the stretching aspect is different, Campbell adds. “A lot of yoga poses are static stretching, whereas in Pilates, it doesn't look like you're holding a stretch. You’re stretching through movement. That dynamic stretching is better for people who have limited flexibility because they will gain flexibility quicker with dynamic versus static stretching.”
Mat Pilates vs. barre
: “And pulse for 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1…” Pilates cue or barre cue? Hard to tell. Both modalities get into those teeny-tiny muscle groups you hardly knew existed. But unlike mat Pilates—where you’ll typically start lying down and work your way to standing at the very end—barre is rooted in ballet-inspired motion and largely takes place standing at a literal ballet barre (hence the name).
Mat Pilates vs. reformer Pilates:
Whereas mat Pilates is you working against gravity, reformer Pilates adds spring tension into the mix. “The springs give you resistance and they also give you assistance,” Campbell says. While springs make some exercises more challenging, they make others less challenging. “Some exercises that you find very hard on the mat will actually feel a little easier on the reformer because the straps and the springs and the machine itself is guiding you through the movement,” she says.
Mat Pilates vs. sculpt classes:
While sculpt classes may include Pilates-inspired movements, they’re typically more of a hybrid workout blending strength and cardio and don’t follow a prescribed flow.
What You Need For A Mat Pilates Workout
One of the great aspects of a mat practice—unlike reformer or Cadillac work, which require bulky, expensive apparatus—is that you need very little equipment to start. If you want to keep your initial investment as minimal as possible, all you really need is a mat (and maybe not even that if you plan to practice at a studio that provides one!). Here, a basic toolkit to get you started:
Airex Pilates 190

If you’re practicing from home or your studio doesn’t provide a mat, you’ll want one that offers a little extra cushion than the standard yoga mat. That’s because there are a handful of mat exercises during which you’ll roll on your back, and you’ll want that extra thickness to protect your vertebrae. Campbell likes this Airex model for this very reason.
ProBody Pilates Ring And Mini Exercise Ball

Pilates teachers love a good prop. You may want to have a few options—like this Pilates ring (a.k.a. magic circle) and ball set—handy for online classes.
Pointe Studio Grip Sock

Many studios require sticky socks for both safety and sanitary reasons, so stashing a pair in your gym bag is always a good idea. These Pointe Studio socks offer a non-slip bottom in tons of cute colors and patterns.
Bala The Play Mat

Looking for a mat that's a bit more

? The 8mm-sized Bala Play Mat is another cushy option (and it’s antimicrobial, to boot!).
Tips And Advice For Your First Mat Pilates Workout
Before you sign up for your first flow, it’s a good idea to check out the teacher’s credentials. In a perfect world, say both Belcher and Campbell, a Pilates instructor would be comprehensively certified through a 600-hour program. This rigorous teacher training means they are not only experts in all the exercises and apparatus, but they also have an understanding of anatomy and how to safely modify the work for special cases, such as pregnancy, osteoporosis, or a knee injury.
All that said, Belcher adds that there are many great instructors out there who’ve only been mat certified, and they could be a good option too. “Some sort of Pilates-focused certification would be the very least I would be looking for,” she says. (That certified personal trainer who’s dabbling in Pilates at your neighborhood gym but has no formal Pilates training? You’ll probably want to pass.)
Another thing Belcher says to look out for: class size. Ten students or fewer is ideal for getting personalized attention and corrections. If a teacher is trying to mind 30 different bodies, they probably won’t be paying too close attention to yours.
If you sign up for a classical mat class, it will likely follow what Pilates pros call “the order”—a sequence prescribed by Pilates himself for maximum flow. The teacher may start with a few warmups that focus on your breath or stretching out certain parts of the body (this is often called “pre-Pilates”), but the official start of the work will be marked by the hundred (see instructions for how to do that below!).
From there, each exercise will seamlessly flow into the next—the hundred into the roll-up, the roll-up into single-leg circles, single-leg circles into rolling like a ball, etc. You will be in pretty constant movement but the rep count will most likely be low—and that’s by design, says Campbell: “We're not working the muscles to fatigue, but we're working them to efficiency.” That also means if an exercise doesn’t feel good on your body, you can feel free to sit it out, knowing that you’ll rejoin the flow a minute later.
Keep in mind that most teachers do not demonstrate the actual exercises but rather verbally walk you through them, so Campbell recommends avoiding the front row in your first class and opting instead for the middle or back where you can see what other more seasoned students are doing. “Give yourself some grace and some patience and some time because there is a lot of terminology and there's a lot of things that'll be foreign at first,” Belcher adds.
Common Mat Pilates Terms
Powerhouse
: “One big word that we use in Pilates is ‘powerhouse,’” Campbell says. “Some people think of it as just your abs, but it's really everything from your sternum to your kneecap—it's your abs, it's your low back, it's your glutes, it’s your hip flexors.”
Midline
: Another anatomical-leaning term, the midline refers to the center line of your body that runs from head to toe. “Hug the midline is something I often say, and that's kind of weird to somebody who's never done Pilates or yoga, but it's very common in our practice,” Campbell says. “That's where you really squeeze your inner thighs together or squeeze your sit bones, your glutes together.”
Pilates curl
: This is the standard body positioning for many core-focused exercises, like the ab series. As you lie on your back, you curl your head, neck, and shoulders off the mat so just the tips of your shoulder blades are grazing the mat.
Pilates stance
: This describes the slight external rotation of your legs, where your feet create a V-shape—heels are together, toes are apart to about the width of your fist.
As for how many mat classes a week you should take, that really depends on your goals, Campbell says: “Three times a week is really the magical number. If you have an active lifestyle elsewhere, and you're doing Pilates once a week, that's great. If Pilates is all you're doing and you want to see results, you’ve got to do it at least three times a week.”

Diastasis Recti Exercises: Strengthen Your Core Safely After Pregnancy And Beyond
Experts share everything you need to know to heal your abs separation.

Pregnancy
does some pretty incredible things to your body, but for many women, it can also leave you feeling a little unfamiliar in your own skin afterward. One of the most common changes is diastasis recti (or diastasis recti for short), which happens when your
abs
separate down the middle as your belly grows. It happens to more than half of women who’ve had a baby, according to a
2021 study in
Hernia
. Diastasis recti can leave women with some frustrating side effects after birth, including
core weakness
and
lower back pain
, however, you don’t have to live with it forever. With the right exercises, you can help close that gap,
strengthen your core
, and feel more like yourself again.
Whether you’re pregnant and want to prevent diastasis recti, or you’re already on the other side and ready to
reclaim your strength
, this guide has got you covered. With the help of Sarah Kostyukovsky, DPT, OCS, a physical therapist and orthopedic specialist, we’ll walk you through what causes the condition, why it matters, and offer safe, effective diastasis recti exercises that you can start doing today to
rebuild your core
as you
navigate  postpartum
.
Meet the expert:
Sarah Kostyukovsky
, DPT, OCS, is a physical therapist, orthopedic specialist, and co-founder of
Flow Physio
, a physical therapy practice rooted in orthopedic training and the treatment of pelvic floor dysfunction.
What is diastasis recti?
Diastasis recti is the separation of the rectus abdominis muscles, commonly known as the "six-pack" muscles, along the midline of your stomach. “There is a fascial or soft tissue connection at the middle of the rectus abdominis muscle that allows for stretching and movement of our abdomen," says Kostyukovsky. During pregnancy, as the
uterus
and belly expand, the connective tissue between these muscles (called the linea alba) stretches to accommodate the growing fetus. For many women, this stretching leads to a noticeable gap or separation between the muscles, ultimately compromising
strength and stability in the core
. While this separation is a natural part of pregnancy, issues arise when the muscles don’t naturally come back together postpartum.
Everyone that carries a pregnancy to term will experience
some
diastasis (a.k.a. separation) of their abs, says Kostyukovsky, with many cases healing on their own with typical training and activity. In fact, anyone—men and women, alike—can develop diastasis recti if they have poor patterns of engaging their abs or poor control, she says.

How To Know If You Have Diastasis Recti
Before addressing diastasis recti, you need to establish if you're actually experiencing it—and how extreme it is. While it’s always best to see a specialized doctor or physical therapist to officially diagnose and address this condition, here's a simple test you can try at home to help you determine if you might be experiencing diastasis recti:
Lie on your back on a firm surface with your knees bent and your abdominals relaxed.
Use your index, middle, and ring finger to feel the area just below your sternum and down towards your pubic bone.
Run your fingers side-to-side across the length of your abs to see if you can feel where the "walls" of the rectus muscles are by pressing down gently to see how deep your fingers will sink.
If your fingers sink in significantly and/or you can fit multiple fingers (3+) in between the walls of the rectus abdominis, this is suggestive of a weakening and/or widening of that fascial connection between the abdominal muscles.
Then, do a curl up or lift your head and shoulders up to see what happens to the tissue in the middle of the abdomen. You should feel the abdominal walls come closer together as you lift. If you feel like your fingers can sink deep into your abdomen at rest, you also want to feel your fingers being pushed out as you curl up. If you don't feel the muscles "close" or your fingers continue to sink deeper, it's a good idea to have your abdominal wall professionally assessed.
Benefits Of Diastasis Recti Exercises
Abdominal separation can affect your body in ways far deeper than aesthetics. Without the support of a strong core, you’re more vulnerable to back pain,
poor posture
, and difficulty performing everyday activities such as lifting, carrying your baby, or doing normal household chores. The core isn’t just about having toned abs—it helps stabilize your spine and entire body, so when those muscles are stretched or weakened, it has a ripple effect on your overall physical function. Left untreated, diastasis recti may also lead to pelvic floor dysfunction, hernias, and long-term issues with
mobility
and balance. Thankfully, there's plenty you can do to address it during pregnancy and postpartum.
After diagnosis, determining what diastasis recti exercises you should be doing is the next most important step for healing, says Kostyukovsky. The thing is, not all core exercises are appropriate for someone with diastasis recti. Some traditional core exercises, such as crunches and situps, can actually worsen the problem. "Doing core exercises that create tension across that linea alba reinforces good engagement patterns and strategies to reduce that ‘leaking’ of tension that perpetuates diastasis recti." Certain core exercises also help build up the muscles of the abdominal wall, which can reduce the depth of the gap, improve the aesthetic and function of your abdominal wall, and better support the way you move your body overall.
To prevent and heal diastasis recti, you'll want to focus on functional core exercises that emphasize
breathwork
, target the deep core muscles (including the transverse abdominis, pelvic floor, and diaphragm), and focus on controlled muscle engagement.

Time:
10 minutes or less |
Equipment:
Mat (optional) |
Good For:
Deep core muscles
Instructions
: Prior to starting any of the exercises listed below, Kostyukovsky suggests you practice a few minutes of diaphragmatic breathing in various positions (supine, sidelying, prone, quadruped, standing, etc.) to establish the connection between your abdominal and pelvic floor muscles. Start with at least one round of the three foundational exercises below before moving into the six functional exercises listed below. Start by incorporating 10 to 15 minutes of these exercises into your routine, aiming for at least three to four days a week.
As you get stronger, you can gradually increase the frequency and duration, but the most important part is to stay consistent. When working out with diastasis recti, it's super important to listen to your body. If any of these exercises feel uncomfortable or lead to “coning” in your stomach (raised area of abdomen while exerting yourself), discontinue exercises and contact a licensed physical therapist.
3 Foundational Diastasis Recti Exercises
1. Diaphragmatic Breathing
What it's good for
: Activates the deep core muscles and strengthens the diaphragm.
How to:
Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Place one hand on your chest and the other on your belly.
Inhale deeply through your nose, focusing on expanding your belly (not your chest).
As you inhale, feel your belly rise and expand outward. Your chest should remain mostly still.
Exhale slowly through your mouth, drawing your belly button in toward your spine and engaging your deep core muscles.
That's 1 rep.
Repeat for 5-10 reps/breaths, maintaining slow, controlled breathing throughout.
2. Supine Heel Slides
What it's good for
: Strengthens the deep core while maintaining stability in the abdominal muscles.
How to:
Lie on your back with knees bent, feet flat on the floor, and arms resting by your sides.
Engage your core by gently pulling your belly button toward your spine (without arching your back).
Slowly slide your right heel along the floor, straightening your leg while keeping your core engaged.
Return your heel to the starting position, maintaining core engagement the entire time.
That's 1 rep.
Repeat with your left leg. Try not to let your pelvis rock from side to side as you do this.
Complete 8-10 reps per leg, focusing on slow, controlled movement.
3.
Supine Marching
What it's good for
: Strengthens the deep core muscles while stabilizing the pelvis.
How to:
Lie on your back with knees bent and feet flat on the floor.
Engage your core by gently drawing your belly button toward your spine.
Lift your right leg, bringing your knee up to a 90-degree angle while keeping your core engaged and spine neutral against the floor. Try not to let your pelvis rock from side to side as you do this.
Slowly lower your right foot back to the floor and repeat with your left leg.
That's 1 rep.
Alternate legs in a marching motion for 10 reps per side, focusing on controlled movement without letting your back arch.
6 Beginner Diastasis Recti Exercises
Once you’ve mastered the foundational exercises above, keep those concepts in mind as you flow into the diastasis recti-safe moves below. While the following is a list of “beginner” exercises, keep in mind that everyone, and every
body
, is different. If you’ve given birth (or not) and suspect you might be experiencing diastasis recti—or if you just want to rule it out—it is always best to see a licensed physical therapist for a full assessment and personalized treatment plan that takes your entire medical history and fitness goals into consideration.
1. Bird Dog
What it's good for
: Strengthens the core,
lower back
, and glutes while improving shoulder and spinal stability.
How to:
Start on all fours, wrists under shoulders, knees under hips.
Engage your core by drawing your belly button in.
Extend your right arm forward and left leg back, keeping hips level and spine neutral.
Hold briefly, then return to the starting position.
Repeat with the left arm and right leg.
That's 1 rep.
Complete 8-10 reps per side, maintaining core stability.
Pro tip
: Start with 5 reps on each side, then take a break. If that feels good and comfortable, you can progress to the 8-10 reps.
2. Dead Bug
What it's good for
: Engages the deep core muscles while stabilizing the spine.
How to:
Lie on your back, arms extended toward the ceiling, knees bent at 90 degrees.
Engage your core and press your lower back into the floor.
Slowly lower your right arm overhead and extend your left leg toward the floor.
Return to the starting position, then switch sides (left arm, right leg).
That's 1 rep.
Perform 8-10 reps per side, focusing on control and core engagement. Try not to arch your back during the movements.
Pro tip:
If you find your lower back is lifting up from the floor, try 5 reps of legs only, or 5 reps of arms  only while holding the legs in the tabletop (90-90) position. Once you have the spine position under control, then try putting it all together.
3. Heel Taps
What it's good for
: Strengthens the core and stabilizes the pelvis.
How to:
Lie on back with knees bent and feet on floor, hands by hips.
Lift chest toward the ceiling, keeping neck relaxed and bringing shoulder blades off the ground.
Tap right hand to outside of right ankle, flexing right obliques in the process.
Come back to center, keeping shoulders off ground.
Tap left hand to outside of left ankle.
That's 1 rep.
Alternate taps for 8-10 reps per side, maintaining core engagement throughout.
4. Standing March
What it's good for
: Strengthens the core and hip flexors while improving balance.
How to:
Stand tall with feet hip-width apart, core engaged.
Lift your right knee toward hip height, balancing on your left leg.
Lower your right foot and lift your left knee, alternating in a marching motion.
Continue marching for 30-60 seconds, keeping movements controlled and stable.
Pro tip:
This can be done with or without a band around your ankles. When first doing this exercise, try it near a countertop or wall so you have something to hold onto if necessary.
5. Alternating Leg Lower
What it's good for
: Strengthens the deep core muscles while controlling lower body movement.
How to:
Lie on your back with both legs extended toward the ceiling.
Engage your core and press your lower back into the floor.
Lower your right leg toward the floor while keeping your left leg extended up.
Return to the starting position.
That's 1 rep.
Repeat with the left leg.
Perform 5-8 reps per leg, focusing on keeping your back flat and core engaged.
Pro tip
: Again, try this with bent knees first. Only progress to the straight leg version if the bent knee version is easy.
6. Glute Bridge
What it's good for
: Strengthens the glutes, lower back, and core.
How to:
Lie on your back with feet planted hip-width on the floor and knees bent.
Squeeze your glutes and lift your hips off of the floor until your body forms a straight line from your knees to your shoulders.
Pause at the top, squeezing the glutes a little extra for good measure.
Lower back down with control to the starting position to tap hips on the floor before repeating.
That's 1 rep.
Perform 10 reps, focusing on glute and core activation.
Pro tip
: There are many modifications and progressions to the glute bridge. But mastering this version of the bridge is a great place to begin before trying more challenging version like the single leg bridge or bridge with marching.
How To Integrate Diastasis Recti Exercises Into Your Routine
Consistency is key when it comes to healing diastasis recti, but the good news is that you don’t need to spend hours a day on core work to see results.
Diastasis recti recovery takes time. Think of these exercises as a long-term investment in your core strength and overall health. By slowly strengthening your core and retraining your body, you’ll be setting yourself up for lasting strength and stability.
If you’re struggling to find time to do these exercises, try making them a part of your routine by pairing them with other daily habits. Whether it’s doing them first thing in the morning, while your baby is doing tummy time, or when you’re winding down at night, every little bit of work helps.
What To Avoid While Recovering
When recovering from diastasis recti, it’s crucial to steer clear of certain exercises that could worsen the condition. Here are the main movements you'll want to avoid:
Crunches and situps:
These can put excessive pressure on your abdominal muscles and worsen the separation.
Full planks:
While great for core strength, traditional planks can strain the midline.
Heavy lifting:
Lifting weights that are too heavy can stress your core and exacerbate the gap.
Twisting movements:
Exercises that involve twisting or excessive forward bending can also aggravate diastasis recti.
Prioritize healing over intensity. Focus on safe, controlled exercises that engage the deep core, and give your body the time it needs to recover properly. Investing in this recovery will set the stage for lasting core strength and stability in the future.
Bottom line:
With consistent practice, diastasis recti exercises can help you feel stronger and more confident, giving you back the strength you need for daily life and allowing you to feel comfortable in your body, whether you’re newly postpartum or working on long-term recovery.

Abs Workouts
This 15-Minute Beginner-Friendly Easy Abs Workout Is Straightforward Yet Effective
This 15-Minute Beginner-Friendly Easy Abs Workout Is Straightforward Yet Effective
You don’t need complicated moves to build core strength from all angles.

Whether you’re just getting into working out or you’re looking to get back to basics, having a few easy
abs workouts
in your back pocket to whip out anytime, anywhere is a must. And just because they're
beginner abs workouts
doesn't mean they're any less effective. In fact,
beginner abs exercises
allow you to focus on your form and muscle engagement,  making your core seriously quake in the process.
Strengthening those
core muscles
is majorly beneficial for fitness performance and daily life in general. Not only is your core the center point for all movement, but these muscles also support your spine and protect all of your organs.
Meet the expert:
Kira Jones
, CPT, is a personal trainer, mat pilates instructor, and the founder of
Cacti Wellness
app.
While some people might be motivated to tone up their tummy for the aesthetic (muscle definition is a badass accessory), working your core is most important to stay injury-free. Targeting all of the muscles that make up your core with accessible yet effective easy abs workouts will help you do just that. These moves will give you the base you need to
protect yourself from injury
and better prepare you to start working with weights and more complex movements, says Kira Jones, CPT. Plus, strengthening your abs muscles can actually help take pressure off the spine to ease
back pain
.
What muscles make up the core?
Rectus abdominis
: your six-pack muscles
Transversus abdominis
: the muscles beneath your rectus abdominis
Internal and external obliques
: side abs
Multifidi: muscles in the back of your core, along your spine
Erector spinae: muscles along the sides of your spine
Other muscles also contribute to what’s known as the “core”—like your pelvic floor and diaphragm—so it really is much more than those superficial washboard muscles. A strong, conditioned core is a must if you want to run, lift, jump, and crush whatever flavor of fitness you like partaking in.
To show your entire core some more love, incorporate the following easy abs workouts into your routine. You can sprinkle them into full-body sessions here and there, or dedicate brief sessions to straight-up core TLC.
Easy Abs Workout For Beginners
Time
: 15 minutes |
Equipment
: Mat |
Good for
: Core
Instructions
: Select five exercises from the list below. Perform each for 30 to 45 seconds, then rest for 15 before continuing onto the next exercise. Once you've completed all five moves, return to the first move and repeat the cycle twice more for a total of three rounds.
1
Deadbug
Why it rocks:
This lying-down move offers your lower back some support as you develop your core strength and fatigues your
lower abs
quickly as you extend your opposite arm and leg.
How to:
Lie on your back with arms extended toward the ceiling, in-line with shoulders, and legs bent to 90 degrees (knees above hips).
Pressing the lower back into the floor and engaging the abs, slowly extend and lower the right leg and left arm (overhead) until they nearly touch the floor. (If someone tried to slide their hand in between your lower back and the floor throughout this movement, it shouldn’t fit! That’s how much you want to press into the floor with your lower back.)
Pause, then return to start and repeat on the opposite side. Continue alternating.
Modify it:
When you’re first starting out, try holding this position with your legs in a tabletop position and your arms perpendicular to your body. That static hold alone can be effective for tuning into and engaging your core.
2
Plank
Why it rocks:
Planks will never go out of style because
they’re a great low-impact movement
to tone your core, back, shoulders, and hips, says Kirner. And while there’s no equipment necessary, you'll be working all the muscles that support and control your spine.
How to:
Start on the floor on your hands and knees and place your hands directly under your shoulders.
Step your feet back, one at a time. For more stability, bring your feet wider than hip-distance apart, and bring them closer for more of a challenge.
Maintain a straight line from heels through the top of your head, gazing at the floor slightly in front of you and pull your belly button toward your spine and engage your abs, quads, and glutes. Hold for 10-15 seconds.
Lower your knees back down to the floor.
That's 1 rep.
Repeat 3 times.
Pro tip:
If you’re ready to level-up, Kirner suggests adding a fourth set or staying in the plank for an additional 10 to 15 seconds each time.

3
Seated Straight-Leg Lift
Why it rocks:
Lying leg lifts can be tough on your lower back if you're still improving that core strength, but this seated modification ensures you'll feel sore in all the right places (read: six-pack muscles).
How to:
Sit with the legs extended on the floor straight out in front of you.
While sitting tall and engaging the core, crunch forward, slightly hinging at the hips.
Keep feet flexed while lifting the right heel 3 to 5 inches off the floor. Pause and lower.
Repeat with the left leg, then continue alternating.
Modify it:
By moving your hands next to your hips, or right behind your hips, makes this move more comfortable and helps improve posture when you're just beginning. You can tent your fingertips so you don't take away from the abdominal work, says Jones.
4
Side Plank
Why it rocks:
Say hello to your side abs with this exercise. Side planks hit your obliques hard (but still get your entire core in on the action).
How to:
Lie on your side with your right forearm flat on the floor, elbow under shoulder, and both legs extended, forming a straight line from head to feet. (Feet can either be staggered for more stability, or stacked for more of a challenge.)
Engage core and lift hips off the floor and hold.
Modify it:
Bring your bottom knee down to the floor while keeping your top leg straight, says Jones.

5
Circuit 2: Toe Reach
Why it rocks:
“This one really isolates the upper abs since the entire movement is generated by a deep contraction of the upper abdominals when lifting the chest to the sky,” explains Wilson. “However, keeping your legs straight and stable will still engage those lower abdominals as well.”
Good for:
Rectus abdominis
How to:
Start by lying on your back with legs extended into the air to form a 90-degree angle with your body.
Hold a dumbbell with arms extended up above chest.
Keeping lower back pressed into the mat, raise shoulders off mat to reach dumbbell toward toes.
Lower back down to start.
That's 1 rep.
Make this move less challenging by using bodyweight only.
6
Tabletop With Knee Tap
Why it rocks:
Work up to that bear plank with this slow and controlled move. Extend your hover as you improve.
How to:
Start on all fours, wrists and elbows stacked directly beneath shoulders. Knees should be directly below hips with toes tucked. Keep neck long and neutral by looking at the floor below you.
Engaging the core, lift knees up off the mat until hips are in line with shoulders.Hover knees for one to two seconds.
With control, lower body to tap knees back to the floor for one second Continue hovering and lowering.
Pro tip:
Make sure to engage your core to feel a lift rather than pushing through your toes and palms.

7
Bird Dog
Why it rocks:
This move builds solid stability as your core fires to keep your shoulders and hips square to the floor as your arm and leg extend.
How to:
Start in a quadruped position with wrists stacked directly under shoulders and knees under hips.
Keeping back flat, core engaged, and a slight bend in your elbows, extend your left arm out in front of you at shoulder height and right leg straight behind you at hip height.
With control, bring your extended leg back underneath you, stopping at your hips, and tap that knee with your opposite elbow.
Lower your leg and arm down, then repeat on the other side. Continue alternating.
Modify it:
To simplify this move, extend one leg at a time with both hands planted, and then extend one arm at a time with both knees planted. You can slowly work your way up to extending the opposite leg and arm simultaneously, says Jones.
8
Single-Leg Stretch
Why it rocks:
If bicycle crunches don't feel quite right yet, this modification is a great move to start with.
How to:
Lie on back with left leg extended straight in the air, just above the mat, and head and shoulders curled up off the floor to hug right knee to chest with arms.
Keep your left leg straight and hover your left foot a few inches off the floor.
Slowly and with control, release, straighten, and hover right leg, while bending left leg, pulling knee in towards chest, and wrapping hands around left shin.
Repeat on the opposite side, then continue alternating.

9
Plank With Knee Tap
How to:
Start in a high plank with shoulders over wrists and shoulders, hips, knees, and heels in a line.
Engage core and glutes, and lower both knees until they tap the floor.
Return to start.
That's 1 rep.
10
Plank Knee-To-Elbow
Why it rocks:
Your obliques work extra hard as you pull your knee to your elbow in this move, which is a staple in many a yoga flow.
How to:
Start in a high plank position.
Lift left foot up off floor and drive toward left elbow while keeping hips level and back flat.
With control, reverse movement to return to start.
Repeat on the other side.
Modify it
: Drop into a tabletop position and complete the movement from there, pulling one knee to the corresponding elbow, says Jones.

The Best Lower Ab Workouts To Switch Up Your Routine ASAP, From A Trainer
The Best Lower Ab Workouts To Switch Up Your Routine ASAP, From A Trainer
And how to effectively activate your deep core with every rep.

It’s a common fitness dilemma: You’re banging out crunches and planks week after week but still not seeing the strength and muscle tone you want in your
lower abs
. That’s a sign it’s time to switch up your routine—starting with the trainer-programmed lower abs workout for women featured below.
All
abs workout routines
are not created equal—different abs exercises target different muscles of your core. But lower abs have a reputation for being difficult to isolate and target when working out, according to Kristina Earnest, CPT, a personal trainer and creator of the Kristina Earnest on Demand app. But the best lower abs workouts for women hit *all* of your core muscles, lower abs included.  In fact, many of the trainer-selected moves below place all the emphasis on those lower abdominal muscles, so you can really feel the burn.
Besides their
six-pack potential
, strengthening your lower abs can
help ease lower back pain
and
improve posture,
says Earnest. And that's not all. "Working your lower abdominals will help stabilize your core and improve your balance," says Emily Fayette, CPT, founder of Healthy Hustle and Apple Fitness+ trainer.
Meet the experts
: Emily Fayette, CPT, is an Apple Fitness+ trainer, founder of
Healthy Hustle
, and former
Flywheel instructor
. Kristina Earnest, CPT, is the creator of the
Kristina Earnest on Demand
app.
Simone Tchouke
, CPT, is a Los Angeles-based functional strength coach.
What are the lower abdominal muscles?
Your core is made up of much more than those six-pack muscles,  says Earnest. There's
the rectus abdominis,
the obliques,
and the transverse abdominis.
The lower abs are within the rectus abdominis, which is that superficial layer of muscle that runs down the front of your stomach, according to Earnest. These are
the "six-pack" muscles
people tend to visualize when they think about abs, she adds. The lower abs are considered the bottom portion of that muscle.
How To Engage The Lower Abs
Pro trainers share their key tips for getting the most out of lower abs workouts for women:
Use the mind-muscle connection.
Just focusing on your lower abs as you move through the below exercises can help you to better activate them, says Simone Tchouke, CPT, a Los Angeles-based functional strength coach. Try picturing
swimming at the beach:
As a big wave heads toward you, hunker down and engage your core so you won't get knocked over. Those are your lower abs, Earnest says. "That tightening of the core is going to help you get the most out of your session."
Slow down.
“When I have people do dead bugs, they often go really, really fast and they don't feel it,” says Tchouke. “But when I have them do it slowly, after 10 reps, they're definitely going to feel the core.”
Just breathe
. You want to exhale during the “work” part of the movement—so when you sit up in a crunch, for example. Remembering to breathe instead of holding your breath is enough to help you get more out of each exercise.
Consistency is key.
While
everyone's fitness journey is unique,
Earnest notes that the lower abs can (and should be!) worked frequently, as either standalone core sessions or mindful engagement throughout other workouts.
10-Minute Lower Abs Workout For Women
Time
: 10 minutes |
Equipment
: Dumbbell, kettlebell, resistance band, mini band (all optional) |
Good for
: Lower abs
Instructions
: Choose five moves from the list of trainer-selected lower abs exercises below. Perform each move for 50 seconds, followed by 10 seconds of rest. Repeat the entire five-move circuit at least twice for a comprehensive lower abs workout.
1
Plank
How to:
Start on all fours with shins and palms flat on mat.
Step back to balance on balls of feet creating a straight line from heels through the top of head with gaze slightly in front of hands.
Spread shoulder blades wide on back, tighten abs, quads, and glutes, and hold.
Why it rocks:
Planks are a great way to build total body strength. They’re a type of isometric hold, which takes a lot of effort and builds both stamina and endurance. Plus, they can easily be modified by planking on your knees or elevating your plank until you can do them all-out.
2
Glute Bridge
Why it rocks:
This is a staple exercise to isolate your glutes, core, and lower back, and if you reach around behind your hips during the move, you’ll be able to feel your low back and glutes activate, says Kirner.
Another perk of this beginner-friendly move
is that you’ll work your entire posterior chain (A.K.A your whole backside) which is a major win for eliminating back pain due to sitting all day long.
How to:
Lie on the ground, with your feet flat on the floor about shoulder-width apart, knees bent and arms by your sides on the floor.
Engage your core and keep a neutral pelvis as you push through your heels and scoop your hips up toward the ceiling.
Squeeze your glutes at the top when you reach full hip extension. Keep your ribs down (don’t flare them or arch your back) and chin slightly tucked or head at neutral throughout.
Inhale as you lower down with control.
That’s 1 rep.
Complete 8 to 10 reps.

【燃脂操4】分腿向前拉伸
技巧:雙腳分開與臀部同寬。腳尖稍微抬高。 將臀部向後延伸，直到身體與地板平行，手臂同時向前伸直到二頭肌靠近在耳朵上。 回到站立為一個代表。 每邊完成10次後，繼續下一個動作。
4
Half Turkish Get-Up
How to:
Lie on your back with right leg and arm straight on the floor and at a 45-degree angle from body, left leg bent so foot is flat on the floor, and left arm extended up toward ceiling (elbow locked out) holding a kettlebell.
Keep eyes on weight, press into your right arm, and sit up, coming onto the right forearm.
Press through the right palm and left foot as you sit up taller and simultaneously shift the right leg under your body until the shin rests on the floor and forms a 90-degree angle with the left leg.
While maintaining your eyes on the weight above, slowly reverse the movement to return to starting position.
That's 1 rep.

5
Staggered Leg Lower
How to:
Lie on your back with hands at sides and legs extended, with a looped resistance band around ankles.
Lift legs straight up to the ceiling so they form a 90-degree angle with your torso. Curl head, neck, and shoulders off of mat so gaze is at thighs.
Keep legs straight and tension on the resistance band, but separate heels so the right heel is slightly lower than the left.
Maintain the distance between feet and lower both legs toward the floor.
Once the right foot is just above the floor, reverse the movement to return to start.
Repeat, leading with the opposite foot.
That's 1 rep.
6
Bird Dog
How to:
Start in a quadruped position with your hands directly under shoulders and a resistance band looped around the balls of your feet.
Draw your navel in towards the spine while raising your right arm and left leg, until they're fully extended and form a straight line with your body.
Keeping your core engaged and torso stable, bring your elbow and knee towards each other to tap below your navel . Extend back out.
That's 1 rep.
Complete all reps on the same side, then switch sides and repeat.

Deadbug
How to:
Lie on your back with arms extended toward the ceiling in-line with shoulders and legs bent to 90 degrees (knees above hips).
Pressing the lower back into the floor and engaging the abs, slowly extend and lower the right leg and left arm (overhead) until they nearly touch the floor.
Pause, then return to start and repeat on the opposite side.
That's 1 rep.
8
Frog Crunch
How to:
Lie on your back with your arms extended at your sides.
Bring your feet into a tabletop position, with your heels pressed together.
Extend your legs out at a diagonal, keeping your heels close together.
Bend knees and draw heels in toward your butt. Extend legs back out.
That's 1 rep.

heavy lifting
, to carrying groceries, to
endurance
sports. "When you solidify and strengthen your trunk, everything else feels easier, says Melissa Kendter, CPT, EvolveYou trainer.

20 Best Core Exercises For Strong Abs
Time:
20 minutes |
Equipment:
Mat, dumbbells, stability ball |
Good for:
Core
Instructions:
Choose two exercises from each group below for a comprehensive
core workout
, programmed by personal trainers.
A:
Single-arm push press
Dead bug
Glute bridge march
Kettlebell bridge pullover
Kettlebell dead bug pullover
Single-arm floor press dead bug
Stability ball dead bug
B:
Side plank
Stability ball rollout
Inchworm
Bird dog
Bear crawl
Stability ball stir-the-pot
C:
Unilateral dumbbell march
Kettlebell goblet squat
Russian twist
Incline mountain climber
Leg lower
Turkish get-up

Complete two sets of the indicated duration or number of reps for each move. Once you've completed all sets of the moves in group A, continue to the next, in ABC order. Alternatively, pick and choose your favorite can core exercises to incorporate into a full-body routine à la carte.
Group A
1. Single-Arm Push Press
Why it rocks:
“This move has greater demands on balance and stability because your core and body have to resist the urge to rotate when you use one arm to press,” says Kendter. As a result, this causes greater activation of the core and obliques, she explains.
How to:
Stand with feet hip-width, holding a
dumbbell
in your right hand.Extend the left arm out to the side for counterbalance and rack the dumbbell at your right shoulder.
Engage your core and slightly bend the knees to prepare. Drive through the feet to straighten the legs (without locking out the knees) while  pressing the weight overhead, keeping your bicep close to your ear and palm facing toward the midline.
Return to start.
That's 1 rep.
Continue for 10 reps on each side.
2. Dead Bug
Why it rocks:
“Dead Bugs are good for just about any skill level because they are a safe and effective way to strengthen and stabilize your core, spine, and back muscles,” says Kendter. “They target the same stabilization muscles as a plank, but without posing as much potential strain to the low back.”
How to:
Lie on your back with arms extended toward the ceiling in-line with shoulders and legs bent to 90 degrees (knees above hips).
Pressing the lower back into the floor and engaging the abs, slowly extend and lower the right leg and left arm (overhead) until they nearly touch the floor.
Pause, then return to start and repeat on the opposite side.
That's 1 rep.
Complete 10 reps.
3. Glute Bridge March
Why it rocks:
“The glute bridge march works the core and glutes, improving stability and strength in the pelvic and hips,” says Kendter. “The glute bridge and all its forms are great at strengthening the gluteal muscles which will make you stronger.”
How to:
Lie on your back with knees bent and feet planted hip-width on the floor.
Engage core, then press into heels and squeeze glutes to raise hips until body forms a straight line from knees to shoulders.
Lift right knee toward chest. Pause, then lower right foot.
Repeat with the other leg.
That's 1 rep.
Complete 12 reps.
4. Kettlebell Bridge Pullover
If you don’t have access to a kettlebell, simply use a single dumbbell.
Why it rocks:
“This exercise increases the strength of the anterior core and glutes, and due to its eccentric nature, it provides a lot of time under tension,” explains Kendter. It also teaches your hamstrings, glutes, and abs to work together, she adds.
How to:
Lie on back with knees bent and your feet flat on the floor. Hold a kettlebell in both hands, resting on top of chest.
Raise hips so your body forms a straight line from shoulders to knees.
Lift the
kettlebell
into the air over chest, then slowly lower it behind you until it nearly touches the ground without arching your back or splaying your rib cage.
Engage core and return the kettlebell over your chest.
That's 1 rep.
Complete 8 reps.
5. Kettlebell Dead Bug Pullover
If you don’t have access to a kettlebell, simply use a single dumbbell.
Why it rocks:
When you’re ready for a progression from the traditional dead bug, the kettlebell dead bug pullover adds an additional load, says Kendter. “It strengthens the abdominal muscles and helps promote neutral spine and anti-rotation.”
How to:
Lie on your back with your legs bent at 90 degrees (knees over hips) and arms extended over your chest holding a kettlebell with both hands. That's your start position.
Press lower back into floor, engage your core, then slowly and simultaneously extend and lower your right leg until your heel nearly touches floor while you lower the
kettlebell
overhead until it nearly touches the floor behind you.
Pause, then return to start and repeat on the opposite side.
That’s 1 rep.
Complete 8 reps.
6. Single-Arm Floor Press Dead Bug
Why it rocks:
This move has greater demands on your balance and stability since your core and body have to resist the urge to rotate when you singular arm press, which causes greater activation of the core, explains Kendter.
How to:
Lie on your back with your legs bent (knees over hips) and arms extended straight up towards the ceiling, holding a dumbbell in your left hand, palm facing your feet. Press your lower back into the mat to engage your core—if someone tried to slide a hand in between your lower back and the floor, it shouldn’t fit.
As you extend and lower your right leg until your heel nearly touches the floor, slowly and simultaneously bend your left arm at a 45-degree angle from your body until your upper arm lightly taps the floor.
Pause, then press the weight back up towards the ceiling and draw the right leg back to meet the left to return to start.
That’s 1 rep.
Complete 8 reps on one side, then complete another 8 reps on the other side.
7. Stability Ball Dead Bug
If you don’t have access to a stability ball, simply press your hand into the top of the opposite knee for a similar effect.
Why it rocks:
Adding a stability ball to your dead bug can boost your spinal and core stability while simultaneously engaging your abdominals, explains Kendter. Trust us, it’s tougher than it looks.
How to:
Lie on your back with legs bent at 90 degrees and arms extended over chest, holding a stability ball between your forearms and knees.
Press low back into the mat, engage core, then slowly and simultaneously extend and lower right leg until heel nearly touches floor and your left arm overhead until hand nearly touches floor behind you.
Pause, then return both knee and forearm to the stability ball and repeat on the opposite side.
That’s 1 rep.
Complete 10 reps.
Group B
8. Side Plank
Why it rocks:
Looking for a killer core move that can be done anytime and any place? Say hello to side planks. “They work the deep spinal stabilizing muscles to strengthen your core, particularly your obliques, without stressing your back,” says Kendter.
How to:
Lie on your side with your right forearm flat on the floor, elbow under shoulder, and both legs extended, forming a straight line from head to feet. (Feet can either be staggered for more stability, or stacked for more of a challenge.)
Engage core and lift hips off the floor. Hold for 30 to 60 seconds.
That’s 1 rep.
Complete 1 rep on each side.
9. Stability Ball Rollout
If you don’t have access to a stability ball, using an
ab roller wheel
for this move will also work, however it may feel slightly more challenging.
Why it rocks:
“This is an advanced exercise which is an overall bang for your buck,” says Kendter. “I love this advanced plank variation since it adds the element of instability because of the ball, which means more muscles are engaged overall.” And, thanks to the “rollout” portion of the movement, it’s going to increase the intensity even more.
How to:
Start by kneeling on your mat and place your forearms on a stability ball.
Slowly move arms forward, until your body forms a straight line. Hold here for three seconds, then roll back until your hips are over your knees.
That's 1 rep.
Complete as many reps as you can (while maintaining good form!!) in 30 seconds.
10. Inchworm
Why it rocks:
“This is a full-body bodyweight movement that increases strength and flexibility within the arms, upper back, core, and legs,” says Kendter. “You have to engage your core to bend over and walk out into a high plank position and back, so you get a lot of bang for your buck.”
How to:
Stand with feet hip-width. Slowly bend over to touch the floor in front of your feet with both hands.
Keeping your core tight and leg muscles active, walk your hands forward on the floor, without letting hips drop below shoulder-level, until you reach a high
plank position
.
Pause in plank position, then slowly walk your hands back toward your feet. Stand up tall.
That's 1 rep.
Complete 10 reps.
11. Bird Dog
Why it rocks:
“The bird dog, like the dead bug, is a simple core exercise that improves stability and encourages a neutral spine,” says Kendter. Plus, this movement uses the whole body to target and strengthen your core, hips, and back muscles, while helping to promote proper posture which can help relieve lower back pain, she adds.
How to:
Start in a quadruped position with wrists stacked directly under shoulders and knees under hips.
Keeping back flat, core engaged, and a slight bend in your elbows, extend your left arm out in front of you at shoulder height and right leg straight behind you at hip height.
With control, bring your extended leg back underneath you, stopping at your hips, and tap that knee with your opposite elbow.
Lower your leg and arm down, then repeat on the other side.
That's 1 rep.
Complete 10 reps.
12. Bear Crawl
Why it rocks:
“Since you're moving on all fours hovering over the ground as you perform this exercise, your core muscles really have to fire to keep your spine, hips, and shoulders stabilized,” says Kendter. The bear crawl is also a great warm up exercise or finisher since it lights up your entire body, she adds.
How to:
Start in a tabletop position at the back of your mat with wrists under shoulders, knees under hips, and neck aligned with spine.
Keeping your core tight and a slight bend in your elbows,  lift knees one or two inches off the floor while maintaining a flat back.
Slowly walk hands and feet forward to the top of your mat, then reverse the movement.
That's 1 rep.
Complete 12 reps.
13. Stability Ball Stir The Pot
If you don’t have access to a stability ball, simply do this move with your forearms on the floor. Instead of moving your forearms in a circle to create instability, you can move your body while your feet and forearms remain planted.
Why it rocks:
Looking for an advanced core move? Try this out because “stirring the pot” on a stability ball works the core muscles by challenging the stability of your abdominals while you balance your forearms in a plank position and rotate, Kendter explains.
How to:
Place forearms on a stability ball and extend legs directly behind you in a
high plank
—your body should form a straight line from head to heels.
Engage your abs and move forearms in a full circle, so the stability ball moves as well, keeping the rest of your body still.
That's 1 rep.
Do 10 reps in one direction, then reverse the circle for 10 reps in the opposite direction.
Group C
14
. Unilateral Dumbbell March
Why it rocks:
Unilateral dumbbell marches are one of Kendter’s favorite moves for a reason. Not only do they train your core stability by adding an offset weight to the center body, but they also offer work on your grip strength, upper body development, and overall athleticism, she notes.
How to:
Standing straight with your feet shoulder-width, hold a dumbbell in your right hand and place your left hand on your hip.
Slowly lift your right leg up until your knee is at hip height.
Then, with control, lower your leg down to the ground. Repeat on the other side.
That's 1 rep.
Complete 10 reps on one side, then switch sides and do another 10 reps.
15. Kettlebell Goblet Squat
Why it rocks:
“This exercise is a must for your core because it not only works your lower body, but the weight in front of your chest forces your core to work harder in order to maintain stability and balance,” says Michael Hamlin, CSCS, a strength and conditioning specialist and the founder of Everflex Fitness.
How to:
Hold a kettlebell and stand with feet slightly wider than hip-width, toes pointed slightly out.
Pin elbows to your rib cage and hold the bell right under your chin, gripping it kettlebell by the horn right-side-up.
Engage your core and keep arms close to your chest with elbows pointing down as you bend hips and knees to squat down as low as you can without letting your lower back round at the bottom.
Pause for two seconds, then drive through glutes, legs, and heels to stand back up to the starting position.
That's 1 rep.
Complete 10 reps.
16. Russian Twist
Why it rocks:
“Russian twists rock your core because it targets your obliques which are often neglected in traditional ab exercises, as well as your rectus abdominis a.k.a. the muscles we typically associate with a six-pack,” says Hamlin.
How to:
Sit on the ground with knees bent and your feet flat on the floor.
Lean back slightly and lift your feet off the ground a few inches, balancing on your butt.
Hold a weight at your chest and rotate your torso to one side, tapping the weight on the ground next to your hip before twisting to the other side.
That’s 1 rep.
Complete 12 reps in total.
17. Incline Mountain Climbers
Why it rocks:
“This exercise is great for your core because it engages your abs and obliques to stabilize your torso as you move your legs,” says Hamlin. Plus, if you don't have access to a bench or chair, Hamlin says you can do this move against a wall which will bring some extra fire to your abs and hips.
How to:
Start in a high plank position with hands on a bench, step, chair, or wall. The more elevated your upper body is, the easier this exercise will feel.
Bring one knee up toward your chest, then slowly bring it back down, focusing on control and keeping your tailbone stable at the top of the movement.
Repeat on the opposite leg while keeping your core engaged the entire time.
That’s 1 rep.
Complete 12 reps in total.
18. Leg Lowers
Why it rocks:
“This movement is great for your core because it targets your rectus abdominus (six-pack) and your hips,” says Hamlin. “Additionally, this exercise can help improve your hip flexibility, as you work to maintain a straight leg position while lowering and lifting each leg.”
How to:
Lie on your back with legs extended and arms resting on the floor at your sides. Lift both legs straight up toward the ceiling.
Slowly lower both legs toward the floor while engaging lower abs and keeping lower back flat to the floor. (Option to modify and alternate lowering one leg at a time.)
Return legs back up to the starting position.
That’s 1 rep.
Complete 12 reps.
19. Turkish Get-Up
Why it rocks:
“Turkish get-ups are super challenging for your entire body and require core stability and control throughout the entire movement,” says Hamlin. Not to mention, this move is also great for improving stability and strength in your upper and lower body, he adds.
How to:
Lie on your back with a kettlebell in your left hand resting in front of your shoulder. Bend your left leg, placing your foot flat on the floor. Stretch out your right arm and leg to the side at a 45-degree angle.
Get a good grip on the handle and press the weight up toward the ceiling, locking out the elbow completely and keeping a gaze on the kettlebell.
With eyes still on the bell overhead, rise onto the right forearm, then push into the palm of the right hand to sit up.
Engage abs, then push through the left heel and squeeze glutes to lift hips until the left thigh is parallel to the floor.
In one fluid motion, raise the torso and slide your right leg behind your body, toes angled toward the back-left corner behind you.
Swivel your right shin to the right so that the foot is directly behind the body and raise the torso to come into a half-kneeling lunge.
Keeping your core tight, drive into the left heel to stand. Slowly and with control, reverse the move back to the starting position.
That’s 1 rep.
Do 4 to 6 reps on one side, then complete the same number of reps on the other side.
20. Squat To Oblique Twist
Why it rocks:
“This exercise is amazing for your core because it works multiple muscle groups, including your glutes, quads, and core muscles,” says Hamlin. “The squat targets your lower body, while the knee drive engages your hip flexors and obliques, helping to improve your balance and stability,” he explains. From there, the twisting motion challenges your core muscles and obliques to work together, helping to improve your overall core strength.
How to:
Stand with your feet shoulder-width and hands lightly touching the back of your ears.
Lower your body into a squat position while focusing on keeping your chest upright and weight balanced between your toes and heels.
Push through your feet to stand back up, and drive one knee up and across your chest, twisting your torso and bringing your opposite elbow to that knee.
Bring your knee back down and return to the starting position.
That’s 1 rep.
Continue alternating between sides for a total of 12 reps.
Bottom line:
“Your core is the central part of your body,” says Kendter. “Its layers of deep muscles help
support your pelvis
, spine, butt, back, hips, and stomach.” Basically, everything from the pelvis up to the neck can be considered part of the ‘core’. These muscles are foundational and essential for keeping our posture strong and tall, while allowing us to smoothly move our limbs through all planes of motion, in all directions, without becoming unstable.

The 20 Best Abs Exercises Of All Time, According To Trainers
The 20 Best Abs Exercises Of All Time, According To Trainers
What feels sexier than a strong core?
by
Jennifer Nied
Updated: Sep 25, 2024 5:57 PM EDT
Save Article
I haven't always loved abs exercises. My old routine of post-run
crunches
and
planks
was not it. Lately, I've found more motivating moves (hi,
practicing pilates everyday
and a
kettlebell abs workout
) that make me look forward to my abs routine. A core-strengthening routine that you actually look forward to doing does exist—and it's all about zeroing in on the best abs exercises for
you
.
What I've learned along the way, and trainers will agree: a strong core pays off in dividends compared to the effort it takes to do abs exercises regularly. Your abdominal muscles play a major role in your ability to hit your goals and are so much more than a "six-pack."
Strong abs
help you
squat heavy weights
,
improve your balance
, hike up the stairs (or a mountain) with ease,
run fast
or long distances, and more. Plus, most of the best abs exercises can be done anywhere, requiring little-to-no equipment to crush the basics. But some abs moves are far superior, so keep reading for our faves. (BTW here's
how to get visible abs
if that's a goal for ya.)
Meet the expert:
Tatiana Firpo
, CPT, is a  personal trainer and self defense coach and training manager for
Fit Hit
.
What are the abs muscles?
Before you can work your muscles with the best abs exercises of all time, you need to know a bit more about your core. An
efficient
ab workout incorporates movements that use *all* of these major muscles—preferably at the same time, says Tatiana Firpo, CPT, a personal trainer and self defense coach.
Rectus abdominis:
a.k.a., your six-pack muscles, which run down the front of your stomach
Transverse abdominis
: deep abs muscles that wrap around your stomach
Obliques:
otherwise known as your side abs, which help you rotate
How To Do Abs Exercises The Right Way
As you approach this workout, focus on pulling your navel in toward your spine to keep your abs muscles engaged, notes Firpo. If you're doing a movement that requires laying on your back, make sure to press your lower back into the floor so your abs do the work—not your spine. (If someone tried sliding their flat hand between your lower back and the floor, it shouldn’t fit!)

How To Do A Reverse Crunch, According To A Physical Therapist
The exercise you need to hit those hard-to-reach lower abdominal muscles.

Looking to amp up your
core workout
with a move that really targets those stubborn lower abs? Enter the reverse crunch. This exercise zeroes in on those hard-to-reach lower
abdominal muscles
, helping you build a strong, defined core.
“This is a great
exercise
that really hones in on the lower abs, strengthening them and, as a bonus, helping to alleviate lower back pain” says
Corrine Carnation
, CPT, a personal and group trainer at Equinox and the creator of Better You, Better Living, a holistic program designed to teach prime movement patterns and box breathing techniques. By strengthening key muscles including the rectus abdominis (the “six-pack” muscle), transverse abdominis (the deep core), obliques (the side muscles), and psoas (more of the deep core), the reverse crunch can not only help improve overall stability and balance but also supports healthy posture, protecting against
lower back strain
. “A stronger core and a happier back? It’s a no-brainer to add this one in!”
Perfect for women who are new to fitness or looking for ways to switch up their ab workouts,  the reverse crunch is a fantastic exercise to help you build a strong core—and solid foundation—for all movement. But when it comes to this lower ab zapper, proper form is key to maximizing the benefits and avoiding injury.
In this article, experts break down the reverse crunch with form tips and techniques to crush the move every time. Read on to discover why this exercise is such a game-changer and learn how to perfect your form so you can reap all of its benefits.
Meet the experts:
Corrine Carnation
, CPT, is a personal and group trainer at
Equinox
and the creator of the
Better You, Better Living
program.
How To Reverse Crunch With Proper Form
Lie on your back with legs extended and arms by your sides, palms down. (For extra support, place your hands under your hips.) Press your lower back into the floor and pull your belly button towards your spine to engage the deep core muscles.
Engaging your lower abs, lift your legs towards the ceiling and hips off the floor, curling your knees toward your chest. Your lower back should slightly lift off the ground at the top of the movement while your upper back and shoulders remain on the floor.
Slowly and with control, lower your hips back to the ground and extend legs back to the starting position.
That’s 1 rep.
Keep your feet hovering just above the mat to maintain tension in your abs between reps.
Form Tips
Go slow
. Control is key in this exercise. Moving too quickly can reduce the effectiveness of this exercise and increase the risk of injury.
Focus on your breath
. Exhale as you lift your hips and inhale as you lower them.
Avoid momentum
. Use your muscles, not momentum, to lift your hips. This ensures you’re working the target muscles properly and also helps prevent moving through the movement too quickly.
Press your lower back into the floor.
If someone were to try to slide their hand in between your lower back and the floor, it shouldn’t fit. This position helps to maintain core engagement and prevents strain on your lower back.
Benefits Of The Reverse Crunch
Chances are you’ve heard of the standard crunch—it’s a classic for a reason. Think of the reverse crunch as the standard crunch’s cooler, more sophisticated older sister. And if you’re looking to take your ab workouts to the next level, it’s a must-try.
The motion of both a standard and reverse crunch effectively isolates and engages the abdominal muscles, causing them to contract repeatedly. So, what sets this move apart, and why should it be a staple in your fitness routine? There are a few key differences that set the reverse crunch apart from the standard crunch, according to Carnation. “The standard crunch targets the upper abs, while the reverse crunch shifts the focus to the lower abs.” She explains, “Instead of lifting your upper body towards your knees like in a regular crunch, the reverse crunch has you lifting your knees towards your chest.”
Let's break it down further:
Targets hard-to-reach muscles
. Unlike the standard crunch, which primarily works the upper part of your abs, the reverse crunch focuses on the lower abs. This shift in focus helps you achieve more well-rounded core strength, ensuring that you don’t just develop those coveted upper abs, but also strengthen the often-overlooked lower portion.
Less strain on the neck and back
. One of the common complaints about traditional crunches is the strain they can put on your neck and lower back. The reverse crunch, on the other hand, involves lifting your hips rather than your shoulders. This motion reduces the risk of neck and back strain, making it a safer option for those with existing discomfort or those new to crunch exercises.
Enhanced core stability
. The reverse crunch doesn’t just offer the aesthetic benefit of toned lower abs—it boosts functional strength. By engaging your transverse abdominis—one of the deep core muscles responsible for stabilizing your spine—you can improve your overall core stability. This translates to better performance in other exercises and everyday activities, from lifting weights to carrying groceries.
Variety in your workout routine
. Let’s face it, doing the same core exercises day in and day out can get boring as heck. Adding reverse crunches to your routine not only spices things up but also challenges your muscles in new ways. Remember: variety is key to avoiding plateaus and keeping your workouts exciting and effective (and the spice of life, depending on who you ask).
Reverse Crunch Variations
There are plenty of ways to tweak the classic reverse crunch to suit your fitness level and goals. Plus, you can try different variations of the reverse crunch to keep things interesting. Here are a few of our favorites:
Easier
Reduce the range of motion by lifting your hips just 2 to 3 inches off the floor. “Think of it as a baby reverse crunch,” says Carnation.
Keep your knees bent to 90 degrees throughout the movement.
Harder
Increase the range of motion by keeping your legs fully extending throughout the entire range of motion. “Imagine you’re reaching the ceiling with your toes,”  says Carnation.
Try slowing down the second half of the movement by resisting the descent of your legs for 1 or 2 seconds. This will intensify the lower ab burn.
Maybe you love the reverse crunch or maybe it’s not quite right for you—either way, it’s always good to have options. Here are some of our favorite reverse crunch alternatives that have similar benefits:
Bicycle crunch
Seated rollup
Double leg curls
High-plank spider crunch
Tailbone curl
Common Mistakes To Avoid
Avoid slamming your hips down—use your core muscles to move with control.
If you just drop your hips, you lose form and effectiveness. Instead, focus on using your core muscles to control the movement both up and down.
Avoid using momentum to perform this exercise.
It’s tempting, but it takes away from the benefits of this move. Make sure you’re using your abdominal muscles to lift and lower your legs. This way, you’ll really challenge your muscles.
Avoid holding your head up without support.
This can strain your neck and shift the focus away from your lower abs. Instead, rest your head on the floor or lightly support it with your hands to target your lower abs and prevent unnecessary neck and shoulder tension.
Avoid arching your back as you extend your legs.
It can strain your lower back and make the reverse crunch less effective. Keep your lower back pressed into the floor and engage your core the whole time to ensure that your abs are doing most of the work.
Can beginners do the reverse crunch?
Yes, beginners can definitely do the reverse crunch! Start by mastering the basic form with fewer reps and sets. Focus on controlled movements and proper form. As you build strength, you can gradually increase the range of motion as well as the number of reps and sets. If you find it too challenging at first, Carnation reminds you that you can modify the exercise with one of the approaches detailed above.
Is the reverse crunch effective and does it help strengthen the core?
Absolutely! “The reverse crunch is a great addition to any fitness routine, especially if you’re aiming to strengthen and tone your lower abs,” says Carnation. It is highly effective for targeting the lower rectus abdominis, transverse abdominis, and obliques, helping to build a stronger, more defined core.
How do I integrate the reverse crunch into my workout routine?
Incorporating the reverse crunch into your routine is simple. Add it to your warmup or to an ab-focused finisher 1-3 times per week, aiming for 2-3 sets of 12-15 reps. It pairs well with other ab exercises like planks, bicycle crunches, and leg raises.

These days, most people understand the importance of basic
core strengthening
, but
functional
core workouts are essential for building a resilient body that can handle everything from carrying heavy bags up the stairs to crushing your toughest workouts.
Functional training focuses on compound movements that engage multiple muscle groups simultaneously, mimicking the way our bodies move during everyday activities. “Think about getting in and out of your car—you rotate as you get in and squat as you sit down,” says
Corrine Carnation
, CPT, a personal and group trainer at Equinox and creator of the Better You, Better Living program. “When you pick something up, you hinge at the hips (hopefully).” Both
squatting
and hip-hinging (hello,
RDLs
!) are examples of ‘functional’ movements.
Functional core workouts, specifically, strengthen the muscles that attach to the
pelvis
or spine. Unlike exercises that isolate specific muscles (such as a crunch), functional moves strengthen the
core
in ways that prepare the body for daily tasks. “Have you ever carried a ton of grocery bags to avoid making two trips? You load up both hands with as many bags as possible and head for the house,” says Carnation. “This is an example of ‘bracing and carrying,’ where you need to keep a tight, braced core to carry the heavy weight.” She notes that a weak core can lead to poor
posture
and an increased risk of injury.
That's right: A strong core is not only a total flex—literally—it’s a key building block for total-body strength. Sculpt yours with the
Women’s Health+ 30-Day Abs Challenge
.
Incorporating functional exercises like the
farmer's carry
into your workouts can prepare your body for real-life activities and protect against pain or injury. But the benefits extend much further. Keep reading for all the reasons you should work functional core workouts into your routine—and exactly how to do so.
Meet the experts:
Corrine Carnation
, CPT, is a personal and group trainer at
Equinox
and the creator of the
Better You, Better Living
program.
Benefits Of Functional Core Workouts
Our bodies move in various directions to perform tasks such as picking up a child, carrying luggage, or getting up and down from the floor. Functional core workouts strengthen the core muscles in all the directions needed for these movements to happen safely and efficiently.
The main core muscles include the transverse abdominis, internal and external obliques, multifidi, diaphragm, and
pelvic floor
muscles, which work together to support the spine, improve posture, and enable movement of the entire body. A strong core provides the stability needed for pretty much all physical activity, according to Carnation. “The core is the foundation of the body,” says Carnation. “Without a strong foundation, everything else can falter.”
On top of making everyday tasks feel easier and safer, integrating functional core exercises in your routine can even elevate your overall fitness performance. A strong core means strong stability and balance, which can positively impact efficiency and confidence when running, whether that's a
5K
or a
marathon
. Functional core workouts also support
strength training
efforts by facilitating a solid foundation, which can help you lift weights more effectively and with better form.
How To Do Functional Core Workouts The Right Way
The best functional core workouts include
bodyweight
and resistance exercises that challenge the core in different positions and directions. Your core is not one-dimensional, so it’s important to strengthen your body through movements that involve twisting, bending, and stabilizing in all directions. For example, a traditional sit-up only engages the core in a single plane of motion, but a workout with
Russian twists
(for rotational movement), lateral side bends (for side-to-side movement), and
plank variations
(for multi-directional stability) ensures you are hitting your core muscles from all angles.
Carnation notes the importance of first activating your core before jumping right into a workout. To do so, she recommends the following: “Act as if someone is about to throw a basketball at your stomach.” It might sound odd, but this cue can be really effective in helping you tighten and brace your core to get ready for impact. It’s best to practice this abdominal bracing technique before going into more advanced exercises in order to ensure your core is engaged and ready for action, Carnation says.
The 11 Best Functional Core Exercises
Time:
30 minutes |
Equipment:
kettlebell, dumbbells, slam ball, resistance band, pilates ring |
Good for
: core, hips, back
Instructions:
Choose five to six exercises from the list below. Complete two to three sets of the indicated number of reps for each move. Aim to integrate functional core exercises into your training routine once or twice a week and build up from there, switching up the moves you choose based on your preferences and available equipment.
As these exercises become easier with practice, challenge yourself by adding or increasing resistance while slightly decreasing the amount of reps. For example, if three sets of 10 reps using bodyweight alone feels easy, try adding a weight or resistance band for two to three sets of eight reps. By the last rep of each set, you should feel ready to stop but not completely at failure. When in doubt, start with bodyweight only, then increase resistance until you feel the exercise is challenging but doable.
Pro tip:
Exercises aren’t one-size-fits-all, so it’s important to recognize when an exercise is either too challenging, too easy, or not comfortable for you. Keep in mind that every exercise can be modified if needed!
1
Farmer's Carry
Targets:
Transverse abdominis, obliques, rotator cuff, deltoids, upper and middle trapezius, rhomboids, quadriceps, glutes
Why it rocks:
The farmer’s carry prepares the core for real-life activities such as carrying heavy things by your sides. It strengthens the core by making you resist the urge to twist, improving stability and balance.
How to:
Stand with feet hip-width, with a kettlebell or dumbbell on the floor outside the right foot.
Hinging at your hips, bend knees and keep back flat as you reach down to pick up the weight.
Engage core as you grip the weight and drive through your heels to stand upright. The left arm can remain down at your side or place hand on hip.
Once standing, pull your shoulders back and down to prevent from rolling forward. Keep core tight and spine neutral.
Walk forward for 30-60 seconds while maintaining a strong grip and upright posture.
Set the weight down.
That's 1 rep.
Turn around and pick the weight up again, this time with your left hand. Complete 4 reps.
Pro tip:
This move can be done bilaterally (holding weight in both hands) or unilaterally (holding weight in one hand only). Play around with both variations to challenge your core.
2
Halo
Targets:
Obliques, rectus abdominis, transverse abdominis, trapezius, rhomboids, deltoids, biceps, triceps
Why it rocks:
The halo exercise improves shoulder mobility and stability while strengthening your core. Moving the weight around your head causes a perturbation (or distracting force) to your body, forcing you to stabilize using your core. This particular halo variation has the added benefit of enhancing upper body strength, targeting the shoulders, back, and arms.
How to:
Standing with feet shoulder-width, hold one dumbbell in front of your face with both hands, elbows bent at 90 degrees.
Slowly circle the dumbbell around your head, moving it clockwise from ear to ear, elbows hugging in.
Return to start and repeat the movement counterclockwise.
That's 1 rep.
Complete six to eight reps.

3
Slam Ball Russian Twist
Targets:
Rectus abdominis, transverse abdominis, obliques, psoas, rhomboids, middle and upper trapezius, deltoids
Why it rocks:
Have you ever worried about straining your back when picking something up or twisting? This move strengthens the core, improves stability, and builds rotational strength to protect your body during these movements.
How to:
Sit on the floor with knees bent, upper body leaned back until abs are engaged (45-degree angle). Hold a slam ball or dumbbell close to your chest with elbows bent.
Keeping arms slightly bent, twist torso to the left and slam ball on the ground next to your left hip.
Twist torso through center to the right and slam ball on the ground near your right hip.
That's 1 rep.
Continue alternating for a total of 10 to 12 reps.
Pro tip:
For an extra challenge, try lifting heels off the ground to balance in a V-sit position with knees bent.
4
Overhead Slam
How to:
Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, a soft bend in knees, and core engaged, while holding a slam ball at your chest with both hands.
Rise up tall on your toes and extend your arms overhead holding the slam ball.
Bend at your hips (hinging forward slightly) and slam the ball on the ground directly in front of you. Exhale as you throw the ball down towards the ground with force. Be careful not to arch your back.
Catch the ball on the bounce while lowering back into the squat position. That's one rep.

5
Half-Kneeling Woodchop
How to:
Start in a half-kneeling position with left leg forward and right leg back, both bent at 90 degrees, holding a dumbbell  in front of chest.
Rapidly bring the weight down diagonally across body until it is in front of right thigh. Keep torso upright with shoulders and hips facing forward.
Slowly raise weight to left diagonal.
That's 1 rep.
Complete as many reps as possible for 45 to 60 seconds on each side.
6
Dumbbell Pullover With Leg Lower
Target
: Transverse abdominis, rectus abdomins, obliques, deltoids, triceps, rectus femoris, iliacus, psoas
Why it rocks:
Keeping your lower back and head flush with the floor while your limbs shift weight will engage your deep core stabilizers. Being able to lift your legs and arms from this position is essential for a healthy spine.
How to:
Start lying on your back, holding one dumbbell horizontally in front of your chest with both hands. Lift legs to a tabletop position, knees over hips, lower back flush with floor, core engaged.
Keeping one leg at a 90-degree angle, lower the other to tap heel to the floor. As the leg lowers, reach arms above head at the same time to lower weight toward ground behind head.
Engage core to lift both arms and leg to starting position. Switch legs and repeat the motion.
That's 1 rep.
Complete 10 to 12 reps.

7
Standing March
How to:
Stand tall with your arms extended in front of you and your feet little wider than hip-width apart with an optional band around feet.
Bring one knee up to your chest and then return it to the ground.
Repeat with the other side, alternating.
8
Plank Knee-To-Nose
Why it rocks:
“The isometric hold of the plank fires up the upper abdominals and is going to require some added anti-rotation stability balancing on one leg,” says Wilson.
Good for:
Rectus abdominis, obliques, transverse abdominis
How to:
Start in a high plank position with your right foot lifted slightly up off the floor.
Exhale and pull the right knee toward the chest while rounding the spine to bring nose toward knee.
With control, reverse movement to return to plank position with right foot lifted.
That's 1 rep.
9
Seated Rollup
Targets
: Rectus abdominis, transverse abdominis, obliques
Why it rocks:
This exercise challenges you to get up and down from lying down without using your hands, which requires strong core muscles. You can do it with a pilates ring, a ball, or no equipment at all.
How to:
Start lying on your back, legs slightly bent, heels on floor, and arms extended straight above your head. Optional: place a mini resistance band around your wrists for an added challenge.
Engage your core and draw your belly button in as you slowly begin to curl your spine off the mat one vertebrae at a time. From head to tailbone, roll up to an upright seated position while keeping biceps by the ears and arms reaching to the ceiling.
Once you reach the upright position, gradually reverse the movement by slowly rolling back down to the lying position.
That's 1 rep.
Complete six to eight reps.
10
Glute Bridge March
Targets
: Glutes, rectus abdominis, transverse abdominis, multifidi, quadriceps
Why it rocks
: This exercise targets the glutes and core, the muscles needed to lift your hips. It's great for anyone who sits a lot, as it both strengthens and mobilizes the hips.
How to:
Start lying on your back, knees bent, and feet planted shoulder-width on the floor. Place your arms on the floor by your sides or, or for an added challenge, extend arms above with hands directly above shoulders and palms facing in.
Engage your core as you press up into a glute bridge with knees, hips, and shoulders in alignment, and hold this position.
From here, raise the right leg to a 90 degree angle, keeping the stationary leg firmly on the ground and pelvis stable. Return right foot to meet left foot in starting position.
That’s 1 rep.
Continue alternating legs and keeping the butt lifted. Complete 10 to 12 reps on each side.

11
Forearm Side Plank
Targets
: Obliques, transverse abdominis, rectus abdominis, quadratus lumborum, glutes, quadriceps, triceps, deltoids, rotator cuff, serratus anterior, latissimus dorsi
Why it rocks:
The classic side plank targets the obliques, which are essential for stability and rotation in daily activities. It also works your shoulders and hips, promoting good posture and alignment.
How to:
Lie on right side with legs bent, right elbow directly under shoulder, and left hand palm down.
Lift hips off the mat, extending legs to form a straight line from head to heels.
Hold the position for 30 seconds. Repeat on the opposite side.
That’s 1 rep.
Complete three to four reps.
Pro tip:
Start on your forearm before trying the more advanced version on your hand.

Why Trust Us?
Situps and crunches
aren't the only (or even the best!) way to strengthen and define your abs. For proof, look no further than this
kettlebell
abs workout. In fact, kettlebell exercises like swings, squats, and cleans target the abdominals in a way that truly can’t be beat. The best part? Kettlebells are for everyone, regardless of age and experience.
The bell’s superiority lies in how it forces you to brace yourself as you move the uniquely shaped tool. The bell part is off-center when it’s in motion (compared with a dumbbell or bar, which have equal weight at either end). This means “your body is constantly under tension, trying to stabilize,” says Elise Young, CPT, owner of Elise’s Bodyshop. “Forced stabilization equals core engagement.” Nice!
Research backs this up: When one group of fit men and women incorporated two kettlebell workouts into their weekly regimen for eight weeks, its participants saw improvements in aerobic capacity and dynamic balance that a control group did not. And the most dramatic increase came in abdominal core strength, which was boosted by 70 percent (!), according to the
study
, which was led by the American Council on Exercise.
Meet the experts:
Lauren Kanski
, CPT, is the creator of the
Body & Bell program
on the Ladder app and a
WH
advisor.
Elise Young
, CPT, is the owner of Elise’s Bodyshop.
Katie M. Heinrich
, PhD, is a professor in the department of kinesiology at Kansas State University.
Benefits Of Training With A Kettlebell
Even the pros have moments of awe when training with the tool. Katie M. Heinrich, PhD, examines the effectiveness of bell exercises in her scientific research as well as in her own fitness routine. “Sometimes when I get done with my kettlebell workout, I’m like, ‘Wow, my abs are sore,’ even though I didn’t do any situps,” says Heinrich, a professor in the department of kinesiology at Kansas State University.
Truth is, your core is the epicenter of every single movement you do. You are better equipped to lift more weight, with better form, and prevent injuries all over if your frame is anchored by a strong center. (Back pain is often a symptom of weak abdominal muscles, so strengthening them may help alleviate those pesky aches, Young adds.)
This guide will teach you everything from which kettlebell weight to grab to how to hold the bell properly. “This program is a great gateway into the kettlebell because you hit all the key
movement patterns
,” says
WH
advisor Lauren Kanski, CPT, creator of the Body & Bell program on the Ladder app (she also programmed and demoed the abs banger below). Playtime starts now.
How To Pick Your Kettlebell Weight
One of the most common questions KB coaches get from newbies is what size to start with. They’re often marked in kilograms (1 kg = about 2.2 pounds). Ideally, you’ll experiment with three sizes in your routine.
Light
8 kg for beginners; 12 kg for intermediates
Use for:
Accessory exercises that work smaller muscle groups, such as triceps and biceps work and single-arm presses
Medium
10 kg for beginners; 16 kg for intermediates
Use for:
Unilateral (using one side of the body to do the movement) and dynamic moves like lunges and swings
Heavy
16 kg for beginners; 20–24 kg for intermediates
Use for:
Bilateral (when both sides of body are used) compound moves that engage multiple muscles at once, like deadlifts and squats
20-Minute Beginner Kettlebell Abs Workout
Time
: 15-30 minutes |
Equipment
: medium kettlebell |
Good for:
abs, total body
Instructions:
Complete the first circuit in order, move on to the second, then try the finisher if you have more gas in the tank. Use a medium KB (10 to 16 kilograms) for all moves if you can. (Consider using a lighter one for the overhead press.)
Do this workout up to three times per week, on nonconsecutive days. Pair it with two days of heavy strength work and 45 minutes to an hour of aerobic activity two or three days a week. That way you’re covering all of your bases.
Want extra spice?
String all the exercises back to back and perform 1 rep of each, smoothly moving from one to the next without putting the bell down. Rest, then repeat. Do five sets or as many rounds as possible in 20 minutes.

How To Do Pelvic Tilts The Right Way, According To Pilates Instructors

Your pelvis is your body's unsung hero. That bowl-shaped configuration of bones in your lower abdomen is the main
support for your spine
and connects to the glutes, quads, core, and
pelvic floor
, so it’s important not to neglect it. Cue pelvic tilts!
In
pilates
, pelvic tilts are a common and fundamental movement involving the positioning of the pelvis in relation to the spine, says Diarra Cummings, a certified pilates instructor and founder of Snatched Fitness NYC. “Pelvic tilt exercises often involve a rocking or swinging action of the pelvis while stabilizing the legs and spine,” she says. But, they’re also a small, subtle movement, so proper form is key to reap all the (major!) benefits.
Meet the experts:
Diarra Cummings
is a pilates instructor, with additional certifications in pre/post-natal pilates, and founder of
Snatched Fitness NYC
.
Jackie Sherwood
,
ACE-CPT, is a pilates instructor and former Joffrey Ballet company member.

.
Benefits Of Pelvic Tilts
This is not an exercise that you’re going to be sore from, but it will help you sustain healthy joints and good
mobility
, says Cummings.
Pelvic tilts help keep your pelvis neutral, easing stress and pain in your back and hips. That's important since a lot of people tilt their pelvis too far forward (anteriorly) or backward (posteriorly), which can mess with posture and cause discomfort, says Emily Claman, CPT, a prenatal and postnatal fitness specialist and founder and CEO of Push.
These exercises also fire up your
lower abdominals
and deep core muscles. "Your deep core consists of your transverse abdominis, multifidus, diaphragm, and pelvic floor muscles, and since we can’t see these muscles, they can be harder to engage and relax,” she says.
Speaking of the pelvic floor, training it may enhance sexual function and lead to stronger, more pleasurable orgasms, according to a
study
in the
American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology
. "Pelvic tilts can contract and relax the pelvic floor muscles," says Burtman, which helps strengthen them as well as increase blood flow to the area.

How To Do Pelvic Tilts
Remember: Pelvic tilts are a subtle, barely visible movement that teach control and fire up the deep muscles of the core. Try incorporating the move first thing in the morning to help loosen your lower back, or as a
warmup or cooldown
during your workout routine.
Time:
10 minutes |
Equipment:
mat, yoga block (optional), stability ball (optional), pilates ball  (optional) |
Good for:
pelvic floor, core
Instructions:
Complete two sets of 10 reps, three to five days a week.
How to:
Lie on your back with knees bent, legs hip-width apart, and soles of your feet flat on the floor.
Keep your arms relaxed by your sides and a natural curve in the lower spine (there should be a slight space between your lower back and the floor).
Inhale, and on the exhale, gently shift your weight into the back-center of your pelvis so your tailbone curves upward, feeling your lower abs engage and sink inward as the lower back flattens. (The gap between your lower back and the floor should close.)
Keep your lower back on the mat and hold for 5 seconds.
Inhale and fully release the tilt, allowing your pelvis to return to starting position.
That’s 1 rep.
Pro tip:
Cummings recommends squeezing a
yoga block
or
pilates ball
between the inner thighs to fire up the inner thigh muscles, stabilize the lower body, and maintain correct alignment.
Common Pelvic Tilt Mistakes To Avoid
Gripping the hip flexors:
Instead of tensing your hip flexors and initiating pelvic tilts with the quads, push down into the feet to
engage the hamstrings
and inner thighs, says Cummings. After shifting into the tilt, think of softening or releasing tension in the hip flexors, says Jackie Sherwood, ACE-CPT, a pilates instructor and former Joffrey Ballet company member.
Compressing the lower back
:
“Pelvic tilts are never about creating compression in the spine,” says Sherwood. Instead, practice visualizing space between each vertebra and breathing deeply to promote a feeling of expansiveness throughout the movement, she says.
Holding tension in the upper body:
Pelvic tilts are all about smooth control, so holding tension in your neck and/or shoulders, which is common for those dealing with
lower back tightness
, is counterintuitive to the potential benefits. Sherwood recommends thinking about melting the ribcage and back of the head onto the mat. You can also focus on maintaining a wide, expansive posture across the chest and anchoring the shoulder blades to the ground, says Cummings.
Allowing the glutes to overpower the abs:
Pelvic tilts are not hip bridges. In fact, they’re not a
glute-focused exercise
at all, says Sherwood. If you find yourself clenching your glutes during the pelvic tilt, pause, reset, and think about only moving “the bones,” she says. “Shift the back-center of the pelvis toward the mat, and the targeted muscles will organically correct.”
Pushing the abs outward:
Yes, you should feel your core engage, but you should not push your abs or belly
outward
, says Cummings. “Pull the waist
inward and hollow the abdominal wall before moving the pelvis into the tilt,” she says.
Pro tip:
You might already be doing pelvic tilts (especially if you do
yoga or pilates
). A lot of core work such as bicycle crunches, forearm planks, and bear planks, require a slight pelvic tilt, says Sherwood.
Pelvic Tilt Variations For All Levels
Press play on each video to follow along with Cummings for her form modifications:
Modify your upper body support.
Instead of lying flat on your back, prop yourself up using a pilates ball (or your forearms). This gives you a clear view of the pelvis and tilt.
Move the pelvis forward and back as you normally would with the same step-by-step instructions as above.
Watch the pelvic movement to help practice control and gain awareness in the subtle motion.
Sit on a stability ball for more challenge.
Sit tall on a stability ball, with feet flat on the floor and hip-width apart.
Tilt the pelvis so the pubic bone rolls upward and the tailbone rolls forward.
The ball will slightly shift underneath you, but this positioning will increase difficulty and work on stabilizing your core.
Come onto all fours.
Come onto hands and knees in a tabletop position (quadruped).
Inhale, then point your tailbone toward the ceiling.
Hold for 5 seconds, then exhale and point your tailbone toward the ground.
Who can do pelvic tilts?
The beauty of this simple move is pretty much everyone can enjoy the perks. Pelvic tilts really shine during and after pregnancy (more on that soon!).
There are a few folks who should steer clear, though. “Anyone with a recent [or] chronic lower-back injury, severe osteoporosis, recent surgery, or a diagnosis of a posterior spinal herniation should avoid the pelvic tilt until consulting with their doctor,” says Sherwood. If you experience pain while performing the move, check-in with your physician or physical therapist.
How To Do Pelvic Tilts During Pregnancy
Quick disclaimer: Always talk to your healthcare provider if you’re pregnant and looking to try any new form of exercise. That said, pelvic tilts can be a great part of a
prenatal
exercise routine as the weight of a baby loads the spine and commonly causes lower back tightness, per Sherwood and Cummings. If lying on your back is uncomfortable during pregnancy, try doing pelvic tilts on a
stability ball
or come onto all fours (quadruped).

These Stretches Are Essential During Pregnancy
The subtle move is helpful for maintaining
mobility
at the pelvis during pregnancy, says Burtman. “Throughout pregnancy, we want to make sure you’re able to tilt your pelvis back (under) to keep your center of gravity from going too far forward and your back from arching too much, because the inability to tilt or move your pelvis can be a major cause of back pain with a growing belly,” she says. Maintaining mobility throughout pregnancy also increases blood flow to the pelvic floor muscles which work extra hard to support the growing uterus and baby, she says.
Your baby also needs to drop lower into the pelvis during labor, and maintaining pelvic mobility can help baby move lower, quicker, says Burtman. And when it comes to the actual delivery (if you deliver vaginally), pelvic tilts can help you to better relax the pelvic floor,
engage your deep core
, and increase blood flow to support a smooth exit, she says.
For
postnatal recovery
, pelvic tilts can help you to regain connection to the deep intrinsic pelvic stabilizers and condition the transverse abdominis (the deepest layer of abdominal muscles). “Pelvic tilts are also a calming exercise and can be helpful in regaining a sense of center amid the flurry of motherhood, '' says Sherwood.
All that said, listen to your body and decrease the range of motion of your pelvic tilt when needed, says Burtman. Only go as far as you can without discomfort.

It’s no secret that the
core
is a super important muscle group. It’s made up of superficial muscles—like the ones that make up the six-pack—but there’s also a part of the core often referred to as the
“deep core”
that you may think about a little less.
Your deep core muscles (we'll get into them ahead) are responsible for stabilization. They support your spine, internal organs, and even help with sexual function. Basically, your deep core might not be as flashy as other core muscles, but it’s just as important, especially for supporting you through all kinds of functional movement both at the gym and in everyday life.
Meet the expert:
Kehinde Anjorin, CFSC, NCSF
, is a functional strength coach and the founder of PowerInMovement.
Luckily, it doesn't take much to work your deep core well. In just six minutes, Kehinde Anjorin, CFSC, a functional strength coach, leads you through an intense workout that targets these muscles fast, so you can make sure you're giving enough love to this stabilizing muscle group.
Follow along with Anjorin in the video here:
What is the deep core?
You can think of your core as being made up of two groups of muscles: the “mover” and the “stabilizer” muscles. The mover muscles are the ones you can see—like your rectus abdominus (a.k.a., your so-called
six-pack
),
obliques
,
erector spinae
, and
hip muscles
. Meanwhile, your deep core encompasses your stabilizer muscles. They include:
Diaphragm
, which allows you to inhale and exhale
Pelvic floor
, the muscle group that supports your internal organs and sexual function
Transverse abdominis
, which is responsible for core stability and acts as a “muscular corset” to support and protect the spine
Multifidus
, which is responsible for spinal stability
While you might not see the muscles of your deep core, you definitely feel the benefits of working them. They enhance your overall functional movement, helping you run, jump,
and
lift heavy weights. Plus,
working your pelvic floor
specifically has the benefit of supporting bowel and bladder continence, boosting sexual pleasure, and even helping you safely give birth—so, yeah, it’s pretty important.
Luckily, there are many moves you probably already do to work your deep core, including planks, squats, or glute bridges. Basically, any type of anti-rotation exercise is likely helping you target this muscle group, which you’ll ideally want to do three times a week. If planks are growing stale though, we’ve got a short-but-intense deep core circuit with new moves that will have you feeling the burn.
What To Expect In This Deep Core Workout
This super-efficient six-minute workout takes you through a circuit of four deep core exercises, twice through. All you need is one dumbbell, a yoga mat, and your body weight.
First up, you’ll be in a tabletop position doing alternating leg extensions. Next, you’ll get into a bear plank for alternating shoulder taps. Then, staying in a bear plank position, you’ll switch up to alternating kicks. Finally, you’ll move into a hollow hold.
Each exercise is done for 30 seconds, with 15 seconds of rest in between. A super strong core is ahead!

You've tried pretty much everything to sculpt a stronger booty…but you’re still not seeing the results you want. It’s a common problem when it comes to
glute training
, thanks to endless misinformation out there about how to get a bigger butt. That is, until now: The WH Glute Gains Challenge is a one-of-a-kind exclusive training plan for
WH+ members
that uses science-backed exercises and methods to increase muscle and tone in the booty area like never before in only six weeks. (
Psst

Sign up for WH+ now
to unlock the exclusive
Women's Health
Glute Gains Challenge, unlimited access to WomensHealthMag.com, a 1-year print subscription, 450+ streaming workouts on the All Out Studio app, and more.
First things first, glute training is not a passing fitness fad—it’s the for-real foundation. The glutes represent the largest muscle group, which include the gluteus minimus, gluteus medius, and gluteus maximus, and are essential for functional movement, posture, and back support.
Meet your trainer, Sandy Brockman, CPT. At 52, she has the strongest glutes of her life—and she’s sharing her secrets.
They’re the driving force behind everyday activities from walking and running to lifting and chasing your kids around. “If you don’t have strong glutes, you’re never going to reach your potential in other workouts,” says Sandy Brockman, CPT, the trainer behind this challenge.
Now, it’s time to dive right into the Glute Gains Challenge. Step one?
Sign up for your WH+ membership
for access to all the programming outlined below. (Your purchase also unlocks our
full library of WH Challenges and Guides
.)
Buckle up for an exciting and effective six weeks of expertly crafted workouts that will build and chisel your strongest backside ever.

Your 6-Week Glute Gains Challenge
This comprehensive training plan will increase your glute muscle mass and shape your backside, not to mention shift overall body composition. (When you increase muscle mass, you also fire up your
resting metabolism
and ultimately burn more fat at rest.)
Sweat With Us:
Join our WH Challenges broadcast channel

Meet your trainer:
Sandy Brockman, CPT, 52, is a personal trainer and strength coach at Kollective in Austin, Texas. She started
strength training
at 15 years old and has practiced a variety of styles over her decades-long career, including powerlifting, Olympic-style weightlifting, CrossFit, and bodybuilding. Over the years, she became hooked on cracking the code to glute strength and hypertrophy for women.

What Makes This Program Different
It uses heavy weights and progressive overload.
Mini bands
and ankle weights can be awesome for some aspects of glute development, such as working on form. But they probably won’t earn you the growth you’re looking for in the area. “Many people love the burn they feel from those pieces of equipment and think it’s a sign of glute growth, but it really just means you’re getting lactic acid and blood into that area,” Brockman explains. (That lactic acid buildup is still a good thing since it’s a fuel source for your muscles as they work—but it’s not contributing to glute gains, she says.)
What’s actually necessary for upping size and strength is sufficient weight and resistance, as well as
progressive overload
—continuously challenging the body with more weight or reps. Quick reminder, though: Proper form is still the priority. It’s better to do a move properly with a lighter weight (at first!) than improperly with a heavier one, Brockman stresses. Noted.
It fixes a problem that most women don’t even know is holding them back from glute gains: hip flexor dysfunction.
Tight hip flexors prevent you from “accessing” your glutes. Instead, you end up recruiting other muscles to get the work done. Brockman has the solve in the form of “corrective” exercises that she incorporates into *all* of the workouts.
Our modern lives aren’t so conducive to mobile hip flexors, thanks to the fact that most of us are sitting all day long. Brockman herself discovered that, for years, she had been using her quads and hamstrings—not her glutes—to drive lunges, hip thrusts, and deadlifts, all due to hip flexor tightness. The more she worked on opening and releasing the tension in her hip flexors, the better the results in her backside.
Research supports this: Low back, hip, and knee issues were all correlated with hip extension weakness in a study in
PeerJ
. And female soccer players with restricted hip flexor muscle length were less able to activate the gluteus maximus, in another study in the
International Journal of Sports Physical Therapy.
It helps you harness the mind-muscle connection for bigger gains.
The most underrated way to make sure your glutes are activating during all those squats and deadlifts is by channeling the mind-muscle connection. How? Brockman packed the challenge with tips to help you maximize every workout even when you're not at the gym.

Glute Training FAQs
How many days a week should you train the glutes to see growth?
Three days dedicated to the booty is a sweet spot for glute growth, Brockman says. But she reiterates the importance of thinking about your glutes
outside
of the gym as well.
How long does it actually take to get bigger, stronger glutes?
It’s possible to put an inch of muscle on your glutes by the end of this six-week program, Brockman says.
Join WH+ now to start the Glute Gains Challenge
What does “glute activation” mean—and how do you activate your glutes?
It refers to squeezing the glutes to create a strong mind-muscle connection that allows you to effec­tively tap into your glutes during workouts. Brockman also refers to “correc­tives” through­out the program: Cor­rective positions help with hip and hip-flexor mobility.
These mind-to-muscle moves help you use your glutes more efficiently in workouts and everyday life and increase blood circulation in the area, which is important for producing the most power and muscle activation whenever you’re performing an exercise. (You’ll see  correctives and activations in all three workouts in the full program.)
What To Eat For Bigger Glutes
When you’re starting to focus more on glute movements, your calorie needs may increase. “The gluteus maximus is the largest muscle in the body, and it requires more energy to power your cells [when] glute training compared to training other muscles in isolation,” says sports dietitian Kelly Jones, RD.
Exactly how many carbs and how much protein to eat is highly individual—but here are a few general rules of thumb.
New to weight training? You might need even less at first—start with 0.63 grams per pound.
Aim for 0.11 to 0.18 grams per pound of body weight every time you eat. For a 140-pound woman, that’s 15 to 25 grams per meal or snack.
Think: olives, avocado, nuts, and seeds for the former and marine sources like salmon or tuna for the latter. Healthy fats are still important; they trigger proper inflammatory responses in your body, which play a key role in muscle recovery. (Vegans can try algae-oil supplements from brands such as Nordic Naturals, Jones suggests.)
Especially ones containing leucine, an amino acid known to trigger muscle protein synthesis, Jones says. (Find it in poultry, fish, eggs, dairy, soy, and oats.)
Take in quick-digesting carbs (a banana or a honey packet) pre-sweat if you haven’t had a meal in three-plus hours.
The 9 Most Effective Exercises For Glute Growth
The must-do movement patterns you’ll see throughout the Glute Gains Challenge workouts.
1. Back Squat
Why it’s effective:
This powerhouse move trains “your glutes, adductors, low back, and quads in a way that makes you very strong systemically,” says Brockman.
How to:
Set up squat rack with desired weight (or use just the bar).
Place barbell on upper back.
Step a few feet back from squat rack, tuck pelvis, squeeze glutes, and descend into a squat for 3 seconds until glutes are slightly below parallel.
Squeeze glutes to come back up to standing.
That’s 1 rep.
Complete all reps, then walk barbell back to rack.
2. Bulgarian Split Squat
Why it’s effective:
“This move emphasizes a deep range of motion that effectively stretches the glute to its maximum length,” Brockman explains. “Stretching a muscle to its full range of motion increases muscle length that, in turn, promotes muscle strength and hypertrophy.”
How to:
Stand 3 to 4 feet in front of bench or box, arms at sides, with a dumbbell in each hand.
Bring left foot to rest on bench behind you, keeping hips pointing straight ahead.
Engage glutes, tuck pelvis, and lower down for 3 seconds, bringing back knee as close to floor as possible. Think about tipping torso forward (nose over toes) as you push hip of working leg back as far as it can go.
Keep glutes squeezed and push through standing heel to reverse movement to return to start.
That’s 1 rep.
Do all reps on one side before switching.
Pro tip:
It takes a little trial and error to find the ideal distance from the box for your body, so play around to find what works best.
3. RDL
Why it’s effective:
“Creating muscle tension in your glutes by actively squeezing them while pushing your hips back helps maximize glute activation,” says Brockman.
How to:
Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand in front of thighs.
Engage glutes, push hips back, and bend knees very slightly as you simultaneously lower torso and allow dumbbells to track down thighs in a 3-second descent until they reach shins.
Squeeze glutes to immediately reverse movement to return to start.
That’s 1 rep.
Do all reps on one side before switching.
Pro tip:
Keep your chest up and “proud” and squeeze shoulder blades together throughout the movement.
4. Deadlift
Why it’s effective:
“This is a powerful movement that engages the glute muscles as well as the hamstrings and back,” Brockman says.
How to:
Stand with feet slightly more than hip-width apart, barbell (loaded with desired weight) directly in front of feet.
Engage glutes, hinge hips back, and descend to grasp barbell with both hands. Immediately reverse movement to stand, with barbell resting in front of thighs.
That’s 1 rep.
5. Lateral Lunge To Box
Why it’s effective:
Because it targets the glute medius, this move helps sculpt the shape of the hips, “giving them a rounder, fuller appearance,” Brockman says.
How to:
Stand in front of bench or box with legs wide, toes pointing forward, hands holding a dumbbell goblet-style in front of chest.
Engage glutes, hinge hips back, and bend right leg to come into a lateral lunge, resting glutes on bench.
Push through heel of right foot to reverse movement to return to start, bringing right hip back fully parallel.
That’s 1 rep.
Do all reps on one side before switching.
6. Single-Leg Bench RDL
Why it’s effective:
“Isolating each glute individually while not having to worry about stabilizing the nonworking leg creates a stronger mind-muscle connection and promotes greater muscle activation in glutes,” Brockman explains.
How to:
Rest left knee and shin on bench, right foot on floor. Hold a single dumbbell in right hand in front of right thigh.
Engage glutes, hinge hips back, and descend while simultaneously lowering torso to  allow dumbbell to track down right leg to mid-shin.
Slowly reverse movement to return to start.
That’s 1 rep.
Do all reps on one side before switching.
7. Hip Thruster
Why it’s effective:
The “king” of glute moves, the thruster gets your hips into full extension at the top of the movement. Squeezing your glutes simultaneously helps “wake up” inactive glute muscle fibers, says Brockman.
How to:
Sit on floor with shoulders and back resting against bench, barbell (loaded with desired weight) at hip crease.
Push through feet and squeeze glutes as you roll onto back of shoulders and thrust hips up (for a count of 3 seconds) until upper body and hips are parallel tofloor.
That’s 1 rep.
Immediately repeat for all reps.
Pro tip:
Focus on the squeeze at the top—not the lengthening or stretching at the bottom—to ensure glutes are fully engaged and create the highest level of muscle fiber recruitment.
8. Weighted Step-Up
Why it’s effective:
“By pushing through your heel to lift your body up, you increase muscle activation and development in the glutes,” Brockman says.
How to:
Stand on box, holding dumbbell in right hand at right side.
Grasp a sturdy object in front of you with left hand.
Engage glutes, shift hips back, and descend slowly for 3 seconds, tapping left toe to floor about 2 feet behind box.
Squeeze glutes and drive through right heel (still on box) to reverse movement to return to start. That’s 1 rep. Do all reps on one side before switching.
Pro tip:
Remember to keep both hips pointing forward throughout the movement.
9. High Hip Hinge With Rotation
Why it’s effective:
This move is “like a mini hip thruster for the glute medius” and achieves serious glute activation, Brockman says.
How to:
Start with left leg forward, right leg about 2 feet back (as if on railroad tracks), resting on right toes. Hold dumbbell with both hands between legs.
Engage glutes, hinge hips back, and descend for a count of 3 seconds, twisting slightly to the left as you bring dumbbell to the outside of left heel.
Gently tap floor with dumbbell, then reverse movement to return to start, being sure to bring right hip back to parallel with left. That’s 1 rep. Do all reps on one side before switching.

Why Trust Us?
Walking
has had quite a year, between the rise of the viral
hot girl walking trend
on social media and walking accessories like
bala bangles
and
weighted vests
becoming trendy. It’s a solid form of
cardio
, but that doesn’t mean you should sleep on other heart-healthy workouts, like the oldie-but-goodie activity of
cycling
.
Walking and cycling are two of the most popular types of aerobic workouts—and there’s a reason. For starters, they’re both
low-impact
, meaning, they’re “easier on the joints than, say, running or
HIIT training
,” says
Olivia Amato
, CPT, a bike, tread, boot camp, and strength instructor for Peloton based in New York City.
When it comes to walking vs. cycling, both activities are great for beginners and can be made more difficult—either by walking with wrist or
ankle weights
, or cranking up the resistance on your bike. Both forms of exercise have perks when it comes to improving endurance, building strength, and losing weight, but one *may* reign supreme.
Wondering which form of exercise to make a mainstay in your workout routine? Ahead, trainers reveal the benefits of both—and how to integrate walking and cycling into your schedule.
Benefits Of Walking
Walking is low-impact
, so it’s easy on the joints, and it’s accessible—all you need is a pair of walking shoes—and you can get your steps in either outdoors or inside on a treadmill, says
Claudette Sariya
, CPT, a NASM-certified personal trainer and alum of the
Women’s Health/Men’s Health Strength in Diversity initiative
based in New York City.

Here’s Why—And How—To Add A Weighted Vest To A Run
Can A Weighted Vest Help Reverse Osteoporosis?
Walking is also easy to intensify. If you’re used to walking on flat ground (or the treadmill), you can level up your walks by going uphill or increasing the incline, Sariya adds. You can also walk faster, or wear a weighted vest or ankle or
wrist weights
.
Walking is also a weight-bearing exercise, as “you're holding up your entire body as you're moving,” says Amato. This can strengthen your lower body and improve your posture, back pain, and
bone density
, adds
Melissa Darlow
, RDN, CPT, a New York City-based registered dietitian and certified trainer. And walking can definitely improve your endurance and stamina, depending on the type of walking you’re doing and for how long. For instance,
power walking
is a great way to build your stamina, Amato says.
Benefits Of Cycling
Cycling is even lower-impact than walking, Amato says, adding that it’s gentler on your knees and hips since pedaling provides support, so you don’t have to hold your body up as much. You can pedal as slow or fast as you want and easily increase the resistance, so it’s easy to control the intensity of the workout. The fact that you can add more resistance while cycling versus walking leads to bigger strength gains and more calories burned, Sariya says.

Bala Bangles are a classic for a reason. Strapping these one- or two-pound wearable weights around your wrists or ankles during a walk or cycling class will add a bit more strength work into the activity.
Walking vs. Cycling For Strength
Generally, walking is “definitely one of the forms of working out that's going to build lower body strength,” Amato says. It’s a better
core workout
than cycling because you’re standing up and you have to maintain your
balance
while moving, Sariya adds. (Walking up an incline works your core even harder because you have to brace it to protect your lower back, Amato adds.) Plus, if you’re wearing a weighted vest, you’ll work all of your lower body muscles, especially your outer quads and calves.

The Pros And Cons Of Cycling For Weight Loss
However, you won’t get a true strength workout from walking because you’re not bearing as much weight as you would if you’re
lifting dumbbells
, for example, Darlow says. You can really only build muscle while cycling if you’re
walking up an incline
, but even then, it’s not a lot, says Sariya. But “in combination with other weightbearing exercises, absolutely, [walking] can lead to an increased level of strength,” Darlow says.
When it comes to cycling, because there’s an ability to add resistance, it builds more strength and muscle in your full body, especially your lower body muscles like the
inner thighs
,
quads
,
hamstrings
,
glutes
,
calves
, and
ankles
, Sariya says. You’re also using your core and
arms
to hold yourself up. The resistance also helps build strength
faster
than you would if you were just walking, Amato adds. So, you can spend less time cycling than walking, and become stronger.
Walking vs. Cycling For Weight Loss
If you want to burn body fat, you’ll want to get your
heart rate
into
Zone 2
or 3—the threshold states where your body burns fat as fuel—either while walking or biking. You can do this by walking on an incline or increasing resistance on your bike—you just need to see that your heart rate hits that threshold.
FYI, you’ll know if you’re doing Zone 2 cardio if your heart rate is at 60 to 70 percent of your max (multiply your age by 0.7, then subtract that number from 208). Or, if you don’t own a tracker, you might feel like your
rate of perceived exertion (RPE)
, i.e., the effort it takes you to do the workout, is at a three to five out of 10. For Zone 3 cardio, your heart rate will be at 70 to 80 percent of your heart rate max, and your RPE will be at a six out of ten.
It’s easier to
burn calories
faster on a bike because you can up the resistance. In order to burn the same amount of calories walking, you need to add weights and increase your speed, Sariya says. So, if you only have 20 minutes and you don’t have a weighted vest or ankle weights, it’s more efficient to hop on a bike if  weight loss is your goal, Amato says.

The most effective way to lose weight is by picking an activity you’ll stay consistent with, Darlow says. So, if you sign up for a
SoulCycle class
pack but you hate cycling, you might end up losing more weight walking if you know you enjoy it more.
Walking vs. Cycling For Cardiovascular Health
Since you can tap into different cardio zones in both workouts, they’re both good for
heart health
. But if you only have a few minutes for a workout, “cycling is going to be your best bet because it's easy and quick for you to change your resistance and be able to switch from your Zone 2 into your Zone 4 and then back down,” Sariya says. But with walking, you might not have an incline or hills nearby to walk on, or there might be people in your way on the sidewalk, which makes it harder to change your speed to reach a higher zone.
However, “as long as someone is finding a regular movement routine and challenging themselves to an extent,” your heart will see benefits, regardless of whether you’re walking or cycling, Darlow adds.
Walking vs. Cycling For Your Goals
Whether your goals are improving endurance, building strength, or
losing weight
, cycling is a better workout, especially if you only have a few minutes to exercise, Sariya says. But adding both walking and cycling into your routine is also beneficial for working the full body, Amato adds.
Here’s how to fit walking and/or cycling into your routine, based on your goals.
If your goal is
building endurance
:
Cycle or walk three to four times a week for 35 minutes, making sure that for 80 percent of the workout, your heart rate is in Zone 2 cardio. The other time should be spent cycling between Zone 3 and 4 cardio, Sariya says. This interval training will help build your endurance.
If your goal is improving strength:
Cycle two to three times a week for 35 to 45 minutes, cranking up your resistance so it feels like you’re going uphill. On a scale of one to 10, you should feel like you’re giving 70 or 80 percent in terms of how hard you’re pushing, but also give yourself a few breaks during the workout. Supplement your cycling sessions with two to three days of strength training.
If your goal is losing weight:
Get at least 30 to 45 minutes of cardio in four to five days a week, whether you’re walking on an incline or cycling with your resistance up. Make sure your heart is in Zone 2 or 3 for the entire workout so you burn fat.
At the end of the day, both walking and cycling are great, and you’ll see gains from both. “What's right for you really depends on your personal goals and what makes you happy,” Amato says. “Finding any way to move that you enjoy is really the goal.” So, whether you’re walking or cycling, make sure to push yourself, and you’ll see the best gains.

What do
Simone Biles
and
squats
have in common? They’re both the absolute G.O.A.T.s when it comes to fitness and strength. Squats make day-to-day movements—like sitting down and standing up—easier, and helps prevent joint pain. Of course, squats also help
sculpt your legs and butt
, which is always a perk.
Kettlebell
squats only take these benefits to the next level. They’re a great way to add more resistance to a bodyweight squat before progressing to a
barbell
, says Jacqueline Kasen, CPT, a Miami-based coach, master trainer, and senior director of group fitness at Anatomy with the StrongFirst Kettlebell certification. Plus, holding a kettlebell—whether in front of you or to the sides—allows for “greater core engagement and stability” in comparison to bodyweight squats. “That can help improve overall balance and coordination,” Kasen says.
Meet the Experts:
Jacqueline Kasen
, CPT, is a Miami-based coach, master trainer, and senior director of group fitness at Anatomy with the StrongFirst Kettlebell certification.
Amanda Hudock Hoffman
, CPT, is a certified personal trainer with the RKC (Russian Kettlebell Challenge certification) based in Ohio.
You can also use the kettlebell to guide you into a deeper range of motion and increase
your mobility
. Take the
goblet squat
, for instance, which is a type of kettlebell squat where you hold a kettlebell in front of your chest (like a goblet). Your hands are on the side of the horns and you squeeze your elbows in, so they’re in line with your wrists: Once you’ve squatted down, you can place your elbows inside your knees, squeezing them in as your knees push out, creating tension. That allows you to drop down farther while keeping
good posture
and core engagement, she explains.
Here's everything you need to know about kettlebell squats, from step-by-step form instructions, to picking the perfect bell weight, to variations fit for pros, according to experts.
Muscles Worked With Kettlebell Squat Variations
Kettlebell squats recruit muscles all over:
Legs
Back
Arms
Shoulders
Core
“Primarily, you’re working the quads and glutes,” says Amanda Hudock Hoffman, CPT, a certified personal trainer with the RKC (Russian Kettlebell Challenge certification) based in Ohio. That’s the case with pretty much any kind of squat, she notes. But the kettlebell goblet squat targets additional muscles in the back, arms, and shoulders because of the way you hold the weight in front of your chest, Hoffman says.
Plus, your core is engaged to keep you upright. “If you think of yourself holding a goblet position with a kettlebell and you’re in the standing position of the squat, it’s essentially the same as a
forearm plank
,” she says.
How To Do A Kettlebell Goblet Squat
Even if you’ve already mastered perfect
squat form
, don’t skip this section. Adding weight with a bell means there are a few more form tips to keep in mind during this move, Hoffman says.
How to:
Stand with feet hip-width apart, then jump three times. Wherever your feet land, Hoffman says, that’s your squat stance sweet spot. Then, line up the handle of the kettlebell with your ankle bones.
Bend knees until you’re in a natural squatting position and grab kettlebell on top of handle with both hands. Shift weight so that about 60 percent rests in the heels and 40 percent rests in the toes.
Drive through heels to standing and lift bell up so handle is at chin level. Don’t let it rest on chest, back and core muscles should be engaged to hold it up.
With toes pointing straight ahead, allow knees to soften and drive forward as you drop. Inhale as you lower for 1 to 3 seconds, keeping gaze forward and torso upright. (Squatting so thighs are parallel or
past
parallel to floor are both correct.)
Hold for 2 to 3 seconds at the bottom. Then, press feet into floor, return to standing, exhaling for 1 to 3 seconds.
That's 1 rep.
Common Kettlebell Squat Mistakes

You lean too far forward.
This is called hinging. “When you squat, think of your torso almost like an elevator,” Hoffman says. “It goes up and down, but it doesn’t go side to side.” The goal of the squat, she explains, is to work your quads and glutes. When you hinge forward, it takes some of the work out of the quads, and you also run the risk of loading the low back, which may lead to pain or injury.
You might find yourself hinging if your ankles aren’t mobile, says Hoffman. An easy fix: Elevate your heels, making sure both feet are propped evenly, she suggests. You can use barbell plates for this, Hoffman notes, or even a cookbooks or textbook under each heel. (Or, purchase actual
squat wedges
.)
Your knees aren't tracking correctly.
If your knees cave in or come too far out, you can injure your joints, Hoffman explains. She notes that there are a few reasons this might happen, like if you’re taller and your stance is too narrow. But often, she says, this occurs due to lack of strength, in which case she recommends switching to bodyweight and potentially even using your hands to pull your knees in or press them out so that they’re aligned with your second or third toe.

Your feet are wobbling.
Your shoes could be the prob, says Hoffman. She recommends
squatting barefoot
or in flat
training shoes
(not
running shoes
!) to avoid unstable feet.
Now, if you’re still struggling with form, you might want to see a trainer for personalized help, Hoffman says. Everyone is different, she notes: You might be hinging forward because you have low ankle mobility, but it also could result from tight hips or an injury you don’t realize is affecting your squat. If you’re concerned about your form, it’s 100-percent worth it to work with a pro, she says.

How To Add Kettlebell Squats To Your Workout
Beginners:
If you’re just starting out with exercise, Hoffman suggests adding kettlebell squats once a week.
Intermediate:
If you’ve got more experience (as in, you’ve been working out for at least six months), go ahead and level up to twice a week, she says.
All levels:
You shouldn’t save these for the end of your workout if your goal is to work a little heavier or build a good foundation, Hoffman adds. “You don’t want to do 30 minutes of
cardio and then squat
, because you’ll be tired,” she says. (Still, be sure to warm up first, activating the muscles and joints you’ll need to use with movements like bodyweight squats,
runner’s lunges
, and planks.)

How Much Weight To Kettlebell Squat
The
best kettlebell
weight depends on your workout goals. “You can have three different kettlebell sizes,” Hoffman says, “and they can all be beneficial for that squat depending what your goal is.” On some days, she adds, you might work really heavy with lower reps and on others you might go for a lighter weight and extra reps. Of course, it also depends on your experience and how you’re feeling on a given day.
Here are some general guidelines regarding the right kettlebell weight for each goal:
T
o build a foundation and muscular endurance
, do 10 to 15 reps with a weight that allows you to feel like you could
maybe
do five more.
To build muscle size
, do six to 15 reps with a heavier weight that allows you to feel like you could
maybe
do two to four more.
To build strength
, do up to five reps with a weight that feels very heavy for you. You should feel like your form would suffer if you attempted one more.

If you’re looking to add kettlebells to your home gym, Hoffman recommends picking one made of cast iron with a powder coat. “It’s worth it to invest in the cast iron bell,” she says, adding that they’ll last longer and will be more comfortable to use. A good starter pack might include three bells: 18, 26, and 35 pounds, Hoffman says. (But take note: KB’s are often sold in kilos, she says. That's a starter set of 8, 12, and 16 kilos.)

The Best Kettlebells, Tested By Fitness Editors
When you incorporate them into your squats, make sure to start light, Hoffman advises. Try a few reps with your chosen weight, focusing on your form, she adds. It might take some trial and error to find the right kettlebell, so keep this in mind: If the weight feels like it’s a seven or eight level of challenging (out of 10), it’s right. If it’s a five or six, it’s too light, and you can go for the next heaviest kettlebell available. And if it’s a 10—unless you’re going for a one-rep max—it’s too heavy and you can go down in weight, Kasen says.
Kettlebell Squat Variations
There are a few different ways to level up your kettlebell squats once you’ve nailed the basics. So, when you’re ready (and perhaps a little bored with the movement you’ve been perfecting), try one of these:
1. Time Under Tension Kettlebell Squat
If you want to challenge yourself in the goblet squat but aren’t
quite
ready to increase your weight, Hoffman suggests amping up your time under tension (stay in the squat longer).
Stand with feet hip-width apart, then jump three times to find squat stance.
Bend knees until you’re in a natural squatting position and grab kettlebell on top of handle with both hands.
Drive through heels to standing and lift bell up so handle is at chin level.
With toes pointing straight ahead, allow knees to soften and drive forward as you lower for 5 seconds, hold at the bottom for 5 seconds, then stand up for 5 seconds.
That's 1 rep.
To challenge your muscles more, hold the bell higher, in line with your face instead of your chin.
2. Kettlebell Front Squat
You can also try an entirely new variation, like the kettlebell front squat (with or without the press as shown). This move, Hoffman says, is when you have two kettlebells in the front rack position.
Stand with feet hip-width apart, then jump three times to find squat stance.
Hold kettlebells up so they rest vertically on forearms, keeping elbows by the ribcage, and maintaining slight wrist flexion so your knuckles are up.
With toes pointing straight ahead, allow knees to soften and drive forward as you drop.
Hold for 1 second at the bottom. Then, press feet into floor, return to standing, and fully extend arms over the top of your head.
Bring the arms back down.
That’s 1 rep.
3. Offset Kettlebell Squat
This squat variation is very similar to the front squat, Hoffman notes, but you’re doing it with just one kettlebell. This variation, she says, is great for evening out any imbalances you may have (if, for instance, one side is stronger than the other). Plus, the offset load adds a ton of extra core work. “Single-arm front squats are secret core,” Hoffman says. “I promise [they] will give you so much more than a sit-up.”
Stand with feet hip-width apart, then jump three times to find squat stance.
Bend knees until you’re in a natural squatting position and grab kettlebell on top of handle so it lands vertically on the forearm. Keep the elbow by the ribcage, and maintain slight wrist flexion so your knuckles are up.
With toes pointing straight ahead, allow knees to soften and drive forward as you drop. Hold for 1 second at the bottom.
Then, press feet into floor, return to standing.
Reverse movement to return to starting position.
That’s 1 rep. Repeat on other side.
4. Kettlebell Curl To Squat And Press
This
total-body movement
allows you to get “the best bang for your buck if you're under a time crunch” because it works arms, legs, shoulders, and core stability. Plus, you’re holding an
isometric
position at the bottom of the squat while doing a bicep curl, which trains stability in your core strength, adding another challenge.
Start in a
squat
position with a kettlebell in each hand, arms extended toward the floor between feet, palms facing away from the body.
Bend elbows and curl weights to shoulder level.
In one motion, press through heels to stand up, raising the
kettlebells
overhead, rotating palms to face inward and stopping when biceps are by your ears.
Reverse movement to return to starting position.
That's 1 rep

If you’re looking to get stronger or just feel more confident in your body, a well-rounded
leg day routine
is a must. A solid
leg day workout
isn’t just about building muscle—it’s about working all the major lower body muscles so you can move better, feel stronger, and crush everyday tasks without getting hurt.
To keep it simple, think of your legs in two sections: the front (anterior chain) and the back (
posterior chain
). The front includes your
quads
, adductors (
inner thighs
), and tibialis anterior (muscle to the outside of the shin bone). The back covers your
hamstrings
,
glutes
,
calves
,
abductors
, and additional little muscles in and around the hip joint. Targeting both sections is key because it ensures balance—for example, strong quads without strong hamstrings, for example, can lead to muscle imbalances that affect your
posture
, stability, and even your risk of injury, says Kristina Earnest, CPT, a New York-based personal trainer. By working your legs evenly, you’ll build a stronger foundation for everything from
walking
to lifting weights.

Leg exercises
benefit both your body's form
and
function. "A strong lower body is essential to so many everyday
functional movements
," says Earnest. "Your lower body strength simply allows you to live your life." Think about it: Each time you climb stairs or squat to pick something up, you’re using strength and stabilization from your legs.
Plus,
leg workouts
naturally engage other muscles in the process. For example, consider a
squat
(one of the very best leg exercises out there). Not only does it fire up your glutes and quads, but it also recruits your core to balance and stabilize your body through the movement. “Training large or multiple muscle groups increases your
heart rate
,” Earnest says, which means you’re building strength
and
getting a cardio boost at the same time. "That is a bang for your metabolic buck."
If you’re ready to build your strongest lower body yet, read on for a killer trainer-programmed leg day routine for your next lower-body workout. (Need a little extra motivation? Just look at
Carrie Underwood's incredible legs
and her

to see what's possible.)
Meet the experts:
Kristina Earnest
, CPT, is a personal trainer with over 10 years of experience leading a variety of fitness classes.
Claudette Sariya
, CPT, is a personal trainer and fitness educator based in New York City as well as a part of the

.
What counts as “leg day,” anyway?
“Leg day” is a dedicated workout sesh focused entirely on strengthening and conditioning the muscles in your lower body. By giving your legs their own day, you ensure you’re hitting key muscle groups with enough volume and intensity to build strength without draining energy for upper-body exercises, says Claudette Sariya, CPT, a personal trainer and fitness educator based in New York City.
It’s often part of a
workout split
, where different muscle groups or movement patterns are trained on specific days. For example, a split might include separate days for upper body (like chest and back), lower body (leg day), and cardio or core-focused workouts. This structure ensures that each muscle group gets enough attention and recovery time between sessions.

How often should you do leg day?
In most workout splits,
one to two dedicated leg days per week
is common, but it really all depends on your fitness level and goals. If you're just starting out, Earnest and Sariya agree that one lower body-focused session per week is plenty—especially since you’ll likely be mixing some lower-body exercises into full-body workouts.
As you get stronger and want to build more muscle, aim for two leg days a week with at least 48 hours of rest in between. For advanced trainees, you can train your legs up to four times per week on non-consecutive days. “Leg days are so important for building strength, but overdoing it can leave you too tired to get results,” says Earnest. So, don’t skip those
rest days
—they’re just as essential as the workouts!
Building A Balanced Leg Day Routine
A good leg day hits all the major lower-body muscle groups, so you’re building balanced strength. To do that, mix in different types of moves from the following categories:
Glute activation:
These exercises (think glute bridges or hip thrusts) wake up your glute muscles so they properly engage during bigger moves like squats or deadlifts, which is key for improving posture and preventing lower-back strain as loads become heavier. (Check out our
Glute Gains Challenge
for more tips!)
Squat:
These exercises work your quads, glutes, and core (like goblet squats or sumo squats).
Hinge:
These target your hamstrings, glutes, and lower back (like Romanian deadlifts or single-leg deadlifts).
Lunge:
Lunge variations build stability and balance because they force your leg muscles and core to stabilize your body in uneven positions, depending on the lunge stance (take the reverse lunge or lateral lunge, for example).
Calf work:
Don’t forget your calves! Moves like calf raises help with ankle stability and overall strength.
Explosive movement (optional):
Add power and spice things up (try jump squats or broad jumps).
If you want to make things harder, add weights or try adjusting your
reps
, sets, and even rest times, says Earnest. The key is to challenge yourself, but always keep your form on point!
Pro tip:
If your goal is building strength and power, do three to six reps and two to three sets. If your goal is building bigger muscles, aim for six to 12 reps and three to five sets. If your goal is muscular endurance and cardiovascular health, increase to 12 to 20 reps, with two to three sets.
Don’t forget to warm up and cool down, too—both are critical parts of a good leg day session. Warming up your lower body loosens the joints and increases blood flow to your muscles, which helps you perform better and prevents injury, says Sariya. (Check out this
Women’s Health
warm-up tutorial
for ideas.) Afterward, cool down to gradually lower your heart rate and let your body recover. (Try this
cooldown guide
to finish strong.)

Here's Exactly Why You Should Be Deadlifting
Struggling To Squat Deep? Try These Form Tips
A Trainer’s Favorite Leg Day Workout For Any Level
Time:
30-40 minutes |
Good for:
legs |
Equipment:
looped resistance band, dumbbells
Instructions:
Perform two to three sets of 10 to 12 reps of each move below, or 30 to 45 seconds if you're going for time. Rest for 30 to 60 seconds between each set before continuing on to the next. Perform the exercises as a circuit, completing all moves before resting for one to two minutes, then repeating from the top for a total of two to three rounds, says Sariya. Choose a weight that feels challenging but allows you to maintain proper form for the entire set, aiming for the last two to three reps of each set to feel tough but doable.
Pro tip:
To make this leg day workout more challenging for advanced exercises, add weights (like dumbbells or kettlebells), increase the number of sets, or opt for single-leg variations where possible (like the glute bridge!) for extra intensity.
1. Goblet Squat
How to:
Stand with feet hip-width and hold a weight in front of chest with both hands, elbows pointing toward floor.
Hinge hips back and bend knees to lower into a squat.
Engage glutes to return to standing.
That's 1 rep.
Why it rocks:
The
goblet squat
is a beginner-friendly way to add heavier weight to your squats and simultaneously activate your core by holding the weight close to your chest and keeping your torso upright. Holding one weight in this position makes it easier to avoid common issues like leaning forward or arching your lower back, which can happen more easily in a traditional squat where one weight is held above either shoulder.
2. Sumo Deadlift
How to:
Holding two kettlebells or dumbbells, stand with feet slightly wider than hip-width, toes pointed out.
Position weights in front of thighs, palms facing body.
Keeping knees slightly bent, press hips back as you hinge at the waist and lower weights toward floor.
Squeeze glutes to return to standing.
That's 1 rep.
Why it rocks:
This deadlift variation really targets your glutes, hamstrings, and back.
3. Banded Lateral Walk
How to:
Place a mini resistance band a few inches above ankles.
Stand with feet hip-width, knees slightly bent.
Maintaining a tight core, step left foot out to side, followed by right.
That’s 1 rep.
Why it rocks:
This move warms up your glutes and hits your often-overlooked glute medius muscles, which are located on the outer side of your hips. These muscles play a big role in stabilizing your pelvis and supporting side-to-side movements.
4. Lateral Lunge With Balance
How to:
Stand with feet hip-width, holding dumbbells at sides.
Take a big step to the left, then push hips back, bending left knee and lowering until left knee is bent to 90 degrees.
Reverse the motion to push back to an upright position balancing on right leg, with left leg lifted.
That's 1 rep.
Complete all reps, then switch sides and repeat.
Why it rocks:
Most workouts focus on forward-and-backward movements, but lateral (side-to-side) movements are important for well-rounded fitness.
5. Calf Raise
How to:
Stand with feet slightly wider than hip-width. (Optional: Hold a pair of dumbbells.)
Keeping the rest of body still and engaged, lift up onto the tips of toes. (Option: Hold for up to 30 seconds.)
Lower heels back to the ground with control.
That's 1 rep.
Why it rocks:
This move isolates your calves, no machines or heavy weight necessary.
6. Reverse Lunge
How to:
Stand with feet hip-width, and hold one dumbbell in each hand at sides.
Step back with right leg and bend both knees as you lower until knees are both bent at 90-degree angles.
Push through left foot to stand.
Step back with left leg and bend both knees as you lower until knees are both bent at 90-degree angles.
Push through right foot to stand.
That's 1 rep.
Continue alternating legs.
Why it rocks:
This staple unilateral exercise works your quads, hamstrings,
and
glutes.
7. Glute Bridge
How to:
Wrap a resistance band around mid-thighs or rest a dumbbell on your pelvis and lie face-up with knees bent, feet planted on the floor about 12 to 16 inches from butt.
Engage core, then drive through heels and squeeze glutes to raise hips toward the ceiling while pushing upper back into the ground.
Pause at the top of  this position and slightly press knees apart.
Lower down one vertebrae at a time to return to start, tapping hips to ground before repeating the movement.
That's 1 rep.
Why it rocks:
Added resistance from the mini band helps you up your focus and burn on your glutes.

Why Trust Us?
It may be time to ditch your
shoes
, according to some fitness experts and athletes. Well, while lifting, at least.
There's no denying that proper footwear is a must for
walking
,
running
, and sport-specific activities like
golf
and
tennis
, but what if I told you it may be worth going shoe-free when
strength training
? The argument behind barefoot training is that it can help you activate and strengthen the muscles of the feet better compared to wearing shoes, which for some, can translate into better overall performance in
functional movements
. But the key to success lies in starting out slow to
gradually
challenge the foot muscles and avoid injury (more on this shortly).
Training barefoot can be particularly helpful when lifting heavy, says personal trainer and yoga instructor Emily Lawrence, CPT, noting that it's improved her
stability
when working with barbells and
kettlebells
, ultimately allowing her to lift heavier with good form. “Without the barrier of shoes, especially
squishy cushioned ones
, I noticed my body was able to stabilize and absorb and produce force better, which allowed me to move better in not only my workouts, but in my daily life.”
Want to know more about barefoot training and whether it's right for you? Below, experts weigh in on everything you need to know about barefoot training, including the benefits, risks, and tips for getting started.
Meet the experts:
Jessa Zinn
, SIP, is a NYC-based, structural integrator, fascia expert, and therapist as well as the owner of
The Fascia Lab
, an online platform offering guided, science-based fascia release techniques.
Emily Lawrence
, CPT, is a personal trainer and yoga instructor.
Gregory Alvarez
, DPM, is a podiatrist at
Ankle and Foot Centers of America
.
Why train barefoot?
As the name suggests, barefoot training is quite literally exactly what it sounds like: training or working out without shoes, or with shoes designed with minimal cushioning to simulate bare feet (these are our favorite
barefoot training shoes
).
Ditching the shoes allows your feet to better connect with and grip the ground beneath you, which forces your body to learn to stabilize, adds Lawrence. "This not only strengthens the muscles in the feet, but also engages the
fascial network
—the complex network of connective tissue that surrounds and supports every organ, muscle, bone, nerve, and blood vessel in the body—by enhancing foot
mobility
, stability, and increasing overall body awareness," says Jessa Zinn, SIP, a board-certified structural integrator, fascia expert, and therapist.
The secret sauce behind barefoot training comes down to the fact that most shoes cause the small muscles in your feet and ankles to be neglected, says Gregory Alvarez, DPM, a podiatrist at Ankle and Foot Centers of America. Think about it: in shoes, your feet—specifically, your toes—can’t really grip onto anything. "The big toe is like the rudder of your ship (a.k.a. your body), and it helps to propel you, stabilize you, and allow you to move side-to-side better," says Lawerence. "If you have shoes on, the feedback of the big toe is diminished significantly."
Without the cushioning and support of footwear, these muscles must work harder to stabilize your body, promoting muscle engagement and
strength development
, according to Alvarez. “This strengthens the intrinsic muscles that support your arches, which can then improve foot function and how efficiently you move," he says.
Benefits Of Barefoot Training
Improved stability and coordination.
Training barefoot fires up your proprioception, or your body’s ability to sense position and movement, says Lawrence. “I like to say proprioception is how well we can move and feel our body in space, and going barefoot allows for more sensory feedback from the ground up,” she explains.
Increased mobility.
“Going barefoot allows for greater
range of motion in the foot
and ankle joints, leading to improved flexibility and mobility, which is particularly helpful for women looking to increase movement fluidity in daily life or during exercise,” says Alvarez.
Reduced risk of injury.
Strengthening the small muscles in the feet can reduce the risk of ankle and foot injuries by helping correct imbalances in your gait, says Alvarez. In turn, this may reduce the likelihood of common injuries like plantar fasciitis or
shin splints
as your feet become more resilient, he says. Not to mention, the increased proprioception that comes from barefoot training can help reduce the likelihood of falling or tripping, adds Lawrence.
Enhanced posture and alignment.
Good posture comes from the ground up, beginning with your feet.
“Barefoot training encourages the body to use natural alignment starting at the feet, which can help improve posture, reduce back pain, and enhance overall movement efficiency,” says Alvarez.
How To Ease Barefoot Training Into Your Routine
Before we get into the specifics, it’s important to distinguish what type of workouts may be a fit for barefoot training. Yoga,
pilates
,
bodyweight exercises
, balance practice, and most fundamental strength training exercises are ideal for training shoe-free, says Lawrence. On the flip side, barefoot training is
not
a good idea when it comes to
high-impact activities
like running, jumping, plyometrics, or Olympic lifting, since the cushioning a shoe provides is important for those activities, she says.
Before you start any barefoot training session, it's best to warm up your feet by rolling a ball under the foot, says Zinn. Most people's feet aren't used to a ton of stimulus since we wear shoes often, so this step is essential to loosen and warm-up the fascia before jumping into more movement. Stretching your feet and ankles before and after training can also help prevent the strain and soreness that can come with working your foot muscles barefoot, according to Alvarez.
Once your feet are warm and ready to go, ease your way into barefoot training. “Begin by incorporating barefoot exercises such as balance work,
yoga
, or pilates, which allow your feet and fascia to adjust to the change, and start on soft surfaces (like mats, sand, or grass)," says Zinn. "It's essential to ease your feet into barefoot workouts by focusing on slow, controlled movements.” So, start small and get used to being barefoot before jumping into heavier, more intense workouts.
If training barefoot is totally new to you, Lawrence also recommends incorporating just a few barefoot exercises in a typical session, such as a
squat
or
deadlift
, and taking note of how your body feels compared to wearing shoes while executing the movement. You don't need to do a full session without shoes to test the waters and reap the benefits! Once you adjust to the feeling and build up strength in your feet, you can up the frequency, duration, and/or intensity of your barefoot workouts, she says.
Potential Drawbacks Of Barefoot Training
Exercising barefoot certainly has its perks for some training styles, but that doesn’t mean it’s risk-free. First and foremost, you want to ease your way into barefoot training because doing too much, too quickly can cause overuse injuries in the feet, says Zinn. Most of us aren't used to working our foot muscles all that much.
People with flat feet, bunions, and existing foot or toe conditions like
plantar fasciitis
may also experience discomfort or worsened symptoms without the proper support from shoes, says Alvarez. If that’s the case, low-profile, barefoot-style shoes (see our top picks below) may be a better option to still reap some of the benefits, without causing extra stress on the feet. If foot pain worsens or persists, it’s also best to check in with a podiatrist, notes Alvarez.
And last but certainly not least, take note of safety considerations. Without the protection of shoes, there’s an increased risk of cuts, scrapes, or injury from objects on the ground. As a result, it’s crucial to ensure the ground is clear, safe, and sharp object-free before taking off your shoes for a workout. Slipping is also a potential risk, so you want to watch out for slick surfaces like squat platforms or gymnasium floors, says Lawrence.
Grippy socks
or barefoot-style shoes can help decrease potential slippage, but always stay alert.

It sounds almost too good to be true. Content creator
Lauren Giraldo
went viral for claiming that simply walking uphill on a treadmill helped her lose 30 pounds—without dieting. In
her TikTok video
, which now has over 14 million views, Giraldo lays out her formula: Walk on a level 12 incline at a 3-mile per hour speed for 30 minutes
.
Giraldo first posted about the routine in a 2019 YouTube video, and it became such a sensation that a year later, 12-3-30 gained its own
Instagram account
, which now has over 150,000 followers. On TikTok, people say the trend has helped them
lose weight
,
burn fat
, and more—and they rave about the changes they’ve seen in their bodies after doing the workout consistently.
If you want a quick, efficient workout you can fit into your day, 12-3-30 can help you squeeze in some cardio in just 30 minutes.
The 12-3-30 workout is trendy, yes, but does it really help with weight loss? Ahead, fitness experts weigh in on the trend and whether or not it’s worth adding to your gym routine.
Meet the experts:
April Gatlin
, CPT, is a certified personal trainer and coach for STRIDE Fitness.
Haley Gott
, CPT, is a certified personal trainer and dance coach.
Gail McGhie
, CPT, is a certified personal trainer and founder of Gail McGhie Fitness.
Grayson Wickham
, PT, DPT, CSCS, is a physical therapist and the founder of the stretching app
Movement Vault
.
Claudette Sariya
, CPT, is a NASM-certified personal trainer, health coach, and the founding instructor at
Sole+ Studios
.
What is the 12-3-30 workout?
First, set the treadmill to an incline of 12 and set the speed to 3 mph. Then, walk for 30 minutes. That's it!
If you can hit five 12-3-30 workouts a week, which is what Giraldo suggests, you'll meet the physical activity guidelines from the
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
, which recommends that adults get at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous intensity activity a week.
However, five days a week might be a little over the top if you’re a newbie exerciser. Doing the 12-3-30 method for two or three days a week, when combined with other types of training, is plenty, according to both Gott and McGhie.
When you’re not doing 12-3-30, you can work in some other types of exercise to keep up your fitness.
Interval training
, weight training, or even
swimming workouts
are great options to help you get active, according to McGhie. Look for exercises in the lateral plane (side-to-side motion), she says, since the treadmill only pushes your body to do one type of forward motion.

Here’s What You Get Out Of Walking A Mile A Day
Overall, 12-3-30 can be a well-rounded, effective workout since it activates many parts of your body. When you
walk on a treadmill
with an incline, posterior muscles like your glutes, hamstrings, calves, and back are activated, says April Gatlin, CPT, a certified personal trainer and coach for STRIDE Fitness, a total body HIIT and treadmill workout. It's a form of resistance training, and you’re building strength in your glutes, hamstrings, back, and core muscles, she adds.
On top of that, the speed adds more difficulty. Perhaps the 3 mph doesn't sound that fast, but combined with the incline, you’ll definitely feel the burn. All of those muscles above are now working at a deeper capacity, Gatlin says.
Your heart rate will also rise since you’re working harder to move at a quicker pace, she adds. And although the workout may feel super tough at first, if you’re consistent over time, your body will adjust to that quicker speed as your body adapts to its “new normal” working capacity, Gaitlin says.
Potential Benefits Of The 12-3-30 Workout
It could help you get stronger.
For starters, the 12-3-30 treadmill routine is a banger of a
lower-body workout
, says certified personal trainer Haley Gott, CPT.
"It's a great way to activate multiple muscle groups in your legs." Your quads, hamstrings, glutes, and calves are all firing, which means that over time, it can help you build lower-body strength.
It helps your heart.
If your current cardio routine needs a shake-up, the 12-3-30 workout could be a helpful addition to build endurance and boost cardiovascular health, says Gott. Moderate-intensity walking, three to five times per week for three months significantly lowered systolic blood pressure, according to a 2021 study in
Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews
.
You’ll burn lots of calories.
Those claims that the method
burns hundreds of calories
are true, Gott says. One 12-3-30 workout sesh can burn anywhere between 300 and 800 cals, to be specific. But the exact number will vary depending on your current weight since it takes more energy expenditure to move more mass, says personal trainer and fitness coach Claudette Sariya, CPT. By comparison, most people tend to burn
at least 100 calories per mile
when running—but again, this number will vary depending on the person and their fitness.
Let’s say you burn 100 calories from 10 minutes of running. When you do 12-3-30, you’d burn 300 calories, so running would be more efficient for you to achieve the same result, Sariya says.
“That said, if you wanted to crank up the caloric burn on a low-impact walk, I’d encourage you to increase your incline versus increasing your speed,” she says.

It could help reduce your risk of injury.
If you need a break from high-intensity training but still want a workout that packs a major punch, 12-3-30 might be a healthy alternative. The 12-3-30 workout itself is tough, but unlike running, this routine puts less stress on the bones, ligaments, and tendons, says Gatlin.
“With 12-3-30, or any higher intensity incline walking, there is one foot soundly planted on the ground at one time, making the body more stable and the risk of injury lower,” she says.
The workout is beneficial for your bones, too.
Incline walking is a weight-bearing exercise, so with the resistance the body creates, you naturally strengthen your bone density, says Gatlin. Exercise also slows bone loss, according to the
Mayo Clinic
, so this trendy treadmill routine could be a winner for your health.
It may help with weight loss—if you’re consistent.
It's important to note that weight loss requires a combination of eating
weight loss-friendly foods
, being in a
calorie deficit
, and moving your body regularly, Gott says, and any potential weight loss from doing the 12-3-30 workout will vary from person to person.
If you’re trying the workout specifically to lose weight, the key to walking for weight loss is to stay consistent. "Find ways that you can add in your walks that will help you stay consistent, because the more often you walk, the more weight loss you will have,” Grayson Wickham, PT, DPT, CSCS, founder of Movement Vault,
previously told
Women’s Health.
"Health is a lifestyle, not a quick fix," he says.

Does Running Burn More Calories Than Walking?
Potential Risks Of The 12-3-30 Workout
Walking on a steep incline can aggravate your lower back since the intense, repetitive movements can lead to your muscles being overworked, Gott says. To that end, stretching and paying attention to
your posture
is really important, she says. Relax your shoulders and avoid leaning backwards on the treadmill, which can cause your low back to tense up even more. If you’re feeling any pain or discomfort while doing this treadmill exercise, it’s probably a sign to stop before you put unnecessary strain on your body.
FYI: This isn't a low-impact workout, and it can stress the body more than you think, says McGhie. This also means that 12-3-30 could lead to injuries for anyone with hip, knee, or ankle issues. "If you have those issues, or you experience
low back pain
, you should start this workout at a lower incline," McGhie says. You can still challenge your cardio and your legs at a lower incline, she says, like level three or five.
If you have a history of shin pain or
shin splints
, this training plan may not be for you, says Gatlin. “To combat shin splints, ensure the body is properly warmed prior to starting the workout and wear the proper type of footwear specific to your gait and stride,” she says.
It’s also important to pay attention to your body as you walk. "When we start to get tired, our bodies will naturally start to compensate," Gott says. Your body might start relying on other muscles to help you power through (like your
lower back muscles
, Gott says). She says this can cause discomfort or a change in your stride.
"You don't even notice it, but when you're tired, your body just does its own thing," she adds. So, if you're feeling any aches and pains beyond your usual post-workout tiredness, consider lowering the treadmill's incline, taking a break, or stretching your muscles out.

How To Try 12-3-30 Safely
This workout is intense, but modifications can help keep it safe and effective at all levels. If you’re new to this training method (or fitness in general), aim for two to three 12-3-30 workouts a week, Gatlin suggests. Start at 3 mph and a lower incline, like three or five percent. Then, gradually add one percent incline each week as your body adjusts to the added resistance. Once you
build strength
and
cardio endurance
, you can up your game and try four or five times per week, if you want.
If you have a solid fitness foundation (previous
cardio and strength training
experience), you can dive into the official 12-3-30 workout as is and do it five times a week as suggested, says Gatlin.
You can also split up your workout into multiple segments to make it safer and more manageable,
Giraldo says
. And don’t worry about doing it perfectly. If your treadmill only goes up to a 10, you can still do the workout at 10 instead of 12, she says.
At all levels, proper treadmill form is also key for staying safe and maximizing the benefits, Gatlin says. Here are her tips for practicing safe and correct treadmill form:
Relax shoulders and hands.
Keep shoulders rolled back.
Hold head steady with chin parallel to the treadmill.
Avoid leaning backwards to maintain upright posture.
Don't hold the rails.
If at any point you feel like you're falling behind on the treadmill unless you grab the rails, that's a sign to lower the incline. Holding the rails reduces the effect of the incline and breaks proper form which can lead to injury, says Gatlin. While it’s okay to slowly build up to the level 12 incline if you struggle at first, your safety should always be top of mind.
As for how you should feel during and after the workout? In general, “You should feel like you are working hard during the 30 minutes,” says Gatlin. Your heart will be pumping, the
glutes and hamstrings
will be activated, and you’ll be breathing heavier, she says. This may sound exhausting, but it’s a good thing. Your heart will thank you for it.
You may also notice some soreness in the following 24 to 48 hours after your workout, which is normal, says Gatlin. It's a sign your body is adapting, and after a few weeks of consistency, you’ll notice major strength gains and improve cardio endurance, she adds. Just throw on your “hot girl walk” playlist of choice, and enjoy your 30 minute sweat sesh.

Why WNBA Star Kelsey Plum Chooses Joy, On And Off The Court
Why WNBA Star Kelsey Plum Chooses Joy, On And Off The Court
How she copes with the ups and downs, and still comes out on top.

Why Trust Us?
Before every game,
Kelsey Plum
spends 5 to 10 minutes visualizing how she wants to show up on the court. And usually, that’s with a huge grin—which is why you’ll often catch her cheesing during intense moments in the action. “Energy is infectious,” she says. “You can’t always control if you make shots, but you definitely can control your energy.”
The two-time Olympic gold medalist has long been a rock for her teammates, leading the Las Vegas Aces to back-to-back WNBA championships in 2022 and 2023; as an
Under Armour athlete
, she also mentors the next generation of basketball stars at her annual
Dawg Class
. Her alma mater, the University of Washington, recently
retired
her #10 jersey—the first women's basketball player to be immortalized in the rafters there.
Though she experienced a difficult year personally, including a highly publicized divorce, she came in clutch on the basketball court through the Paris Olympics and the WNBA playoffs. (In January 2025,
news broke
that Kelsey was traded from the Aces to the Los Angeles Sparks.)
Faith and family keep her focused on her hardest days, and ultimately, she chooses to live—and play—with maximum joy. “Life is rough,” she says. “Being able to surrender is super important.”
Here are the tools that got her through a life-changing year:
1. Take it step by step.
Every day, Kelsey spends quiet time journaling both short- and long-term goals. “For the Olympics, game by game, I had a vision for what I wanted—even practice by practice,” she says. “I’m always making the most of the day if I’m intentional about what I’m focusing on.”
2. Use social media sparingly.
Kelsey stays off her phone until her morning journaling, meditation, and prayer are complete. “It’s very easy to get swallowed up in all that,” she says. “I’m going to start my day with peace, and from there, good things are going to happen.” And anytime she’s a bit on edge or overstimulated, she’ll log off social media entirely—periodic digital detoxes keep her centered.

3. Speak kindly to yourself.
A self-proclaimed perfectionist, Kelsey consistently uses
positive self-talk
, like “You’re doing great” and “You belong here”—and she extends that to her teammates too. “I try to make sure I’m encouraging others the way I would want to be encouraged,” she says.
4. Lean on your people.
“When you’re in a really low place, we all need help,” Kelsey says. “It’s very humbling when you realize,
I’m not going to be able to perform at this level on my own
.” But embracing family and friends who showed up for her in tough times unlocked a new level of gratitude that carried over to her game.

How Reigning Champ Aryna Sabalenka Prepared For The 2025 Australian Open
How Reigning Champ Aryna Sabalenka Prepared For The 2025 Australian Open
She's "finding something new to surprise [her] opponent with."

Aryna Sabalenka
is heading into her third Australian Open final in a row.
On January 25, Aryna will play American
Madison Keys
, who defeated world No.2
Iga Świątek
to get there.
The Belarus native has won the last two Australian Open tournaments, making this a pretty serious honor to defend. But when she starts to feel the pressure, Aryna does what any other 26-year-old would do: She goes shopping and eats a satisfying meal.
"I'm not going to get tired of saying that you have to find something that brings you joy—[whether it's] good breakfast, having a good cup of coffee, enjoying some beautiful view of a beautiful restaurant," she exclusively tells
Women's Health
while chatting about her partnership with
Maestro Dobel Tequila
. "Sometimes I go for shopping, which doesn't make sense. Imagine you have a big match the next day, and the day before, someone sees you shopping? But if you need it, go for it. Don't be afraid that it's going to destroy your game."
It's a relaxed mindset that she's brought to some of her biggest matches: Last year, she promised the rowdy US Open semifinal crowd—who watched her handily defeat American
Emma Navarro
—that she'd buy them all a drink (her signature cocktail, Dobel's Marg-Aryna, to be specific). Dobel
later
took $10 off cocktails in honor of her offer.
On TikTok, she's known for behind-the-scenes vlogs and dance trends, even making a
viral video
with
rival Iga
. "We have to show to the people that we're all nice here and there is nothing behind the scenes," she says. "It was actually fun. Whatever happened on the court stays there."
It's a marked change from a few years ago, when Aryna was known for
sometimes
letting her emotions get the best of her. She was known to throw her racquet on-court; once, she smashed it in the locker room after losing the 2023 US Open to
Coco Gauff
.
But now, Aryna knows exactly what to do when tensions are high. Here's how she keeps her feelings in check—and how she prepared to defend her title at the 2025 Australian Open.
She's trying to learn something 'new.'
After a year of crushing the competition, Aryna's pretty sure her rivals know her playing style by now. So during long days of preseason training—which Aryna says begin at 9 a.m. and stretch into the "late evening"—she worked on improving her game and "finding  something new to surprise your opponent with."

"It's really important to leave bad things in the past and focus in the moment and just try to get better every day," she says. "It sounds simple, but it is simple. You literally have to just go there every day and work on something new."
She prioritizes protein—before and after matches.
When it comes to food, Aryna feeds her body "whatever it is asking for." That means
protein bars
for snacks, and lots of protein and carbs after big practices and matches to help her muscles recover.
When she's playing in tournaments, she also tries to stay away from sugar, since it makes her feel "heavy." But she lets herself celebrate a big win with her favorite sweet treat: ice cream with caramel or gummy bears.
"My God, now I'm thinking about that," she says.
She relies on her team during stressful moments.
When the going gets tough, Aryna's team—which includes coaches Jason Stacy and Anton Dubrov, plus hitting partner Andrei Vasilevski, per the
New York Times
—gets going.
"I surround myself with the kindest people. I know that they cover my back," she says. "I know that I can trust them whenever, if I feel like I need to talk. They're going to give good advice."
During high-intensity matches, Aryna will "throw" her emotions onto them, screaming about whatever's on her mind. It helps her move on quickly.
"We agreed on that, like if I do that, it's okay. I need it. It's nothing personal," she says. "There are so many moments on-court where I would just go crazy and I would lose the match easily two, three years ago, and nowadays, I'm able to go through those difficult situations and actually get the win."

It's important that she lets her feelings out, because if she keeps them inside, she'll get "crazy."
"
I want to destroy everything," she says. "So for me, it's better that I turn to my team, I say whatever, and then I turn back and I'm ready to go. I can focus and I can control the moment."
The one thing her team can't do? Laugh at her emotions—although they "make fun of her" the moment she turns her back.
Another tool in Aryna's kit are her
breathing exercises
, which she uses to "settle the nervous system."
"I turn to the wall and I do couple of deep breath breaths," she says. "You just turn back and you're ready to go."

She relaxes with loved ones, including boyfriend Georgios Frangulis.
Now, if Aryna loses a tournament, she won't let herself get down. Instead, she'll just treat herself to a drink. (She doesn't drink during tournaments.) "I only drink to celebrate something or if I lose the tournament, just to cheer myself up," she says. "But I think it's really important to balance these things, because you're just gonna go crazy if you're not gonna figure things you like to do off-court. You have to go out. You have to explore beautiful cities and just have fun."
Aryna's preferred activity involves a boat that she can "jump from" and just "completely forget about being an athlete." On the road, she's usually with her team and boyfriend Georgios Frangulis, founder of the açaí brand Oakberry. The two were first spotted together in April 2024 and have been together ever since, per
People
. He's currently attending the Australian Open—and Aryna says it's "fingers crossed" that they'll have something to celebrate.
View full post on Instagram
"His support is really important," she says. "Sometimes when I feel really down on the court, I just look at him and I see how much he cares, how much he's worried. I'm like, 'Okay, I have to win this match. I cannot screw this guy. I don't want him to be sad and think that he did something.' It's the best support I could ever receive."
Aside from tennis, the two love to "go for good dinners and explore the world together," she says. "I think it's so healthy and it actually helps us to stay together."
Good luck, Aryna!

The Original Military Program
Try Helen's Workout
Helen Mirren
's illustrious career has seen her take the spotlight both on screen and stage, but she recently revealed the long-standing military
workout
she's been doing for the past 60 years behind the scenes, too.
The actress, who turns 80 in July, told
Women's Weekly
that she was "a big believer in the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) women's exercise regime, which is 12 minutes." Called XBX (ten basic exercises), the program first gained popularity in the late 1950s when it was developed by Dr Bill Orban to improve the fitness of females in the Air Force. According to the XBX plan
pamphlet
, over 600 girls and women participated in the project's creation. "[Exercise] doesn't mean joining expensive gyms," Helen said.
The plan aims to increase
muscle
strength
and
endurance
,
flexibility
and the efficiency of your heart.
The Original Military Program
The XBX plan is composed of four charts of ten exercises, arranged in progressive order of difficulty.

The charts are also divided into levels: 48 levels in total, 12 in each chart. "The time limit for each exercise remains the same in all charts, but the number of times the exercise is performed increases at each level within each chart." For example, in Chart II, you perform exercise 2, 12 times at level 18, but 14 times at level 19.
The University of Waterloo
Chart II levels and reps
All four charts follow the same exercise format:
Exercises 1-4 are to improve flexibility and mobility, and to serve as a warm-up. (
Time:
2 mins (30 secs each))
Exercise 5 is for 'strengthening the
abdominal region
and the muscles at the
front of the thighs
'. (
Time:
2 mins)
Exercise 6 works the muscles of 'the back, the buttocks and the
backs of the thighs
'. (
Time:
1 min)
Exercise 7 'concentrates on the muscles of the sides of the thighs'. (
Time:
1 min)
Exercise 8 is 'primarily for the arms,
shoulders
, and chest'. (
Time:
2 mins)
Exercise 9 is for 'flexibility in the waist and for strengthening the muscles of the hips and sides'. (
Time:
1 min)
Exercise 10 is for 'the
conditioning
of the heart and lungs'. (
Time:
3 mins)
"Do not move up to the next level until you can do your present level, without excessive strain or fatigue, in the 12 minutes," XBX instructs.
Try Helen's Workout
It seems that Helen favors working out using Charts I and II.
Chart I
Exercises 1-4: toe touching, knee raising, lateral (side) raising, arm circling
Exercise 5: partial
sit-ups
Exercise 6: chest and leg raising
Exercise 7: side leg raising

Exercise 9: leg lifting

How Kourtney Kardashian Barker Feels 'Strong' 1 Year After Welcoming Baby Rocky: Postpartum Workout, Diet

Why Trust Us?
After
Kourtney Kardashian Barker
gave birth to son
Rocky Thirteen Barker
in November 2023, she knew she wanted to do things a little differently than she had with her previous three children. (Kourtney previously welcomed
children
Mason, Penelope, and Reign with ex
Scott Disick
.)
"I feel really much more in touch with my body this time around," she exclusively tells
Women's Health
.
"I've just giving myself the grace and the permission to take my time."
Over the past few years, Kourtney
underwent
"five failed IVF cycles and three retrievals" with husband
Travis Barker
before the two later conceived "naturally." So after this pregnancy (which also included an
urgent fetal surgery
), the California native wanted to listen to her body instead of pushing herself to go back to the gym before she was ready.
Now, she's sharing the postpartum diet and workout routine that helped her feel "strong and healthy." Here's what to know.
Walks have become part of her 'daily routine.'
Kourtney wasn't ready to intensely work out until about a year after she give birth to Rocky. So, in the meantime, she incorporated a
walk
—or sometimes two—into her day. (Research
has shown
that walking can boost your mood, help you
lose weight
, fight off illnesses, and even increase
life expectancy
.)
"Some days, I could walk four miles," she says. "I just went on a walk this morning. I do love going on walks as a family—it's nicer, even with friends."

Once Rocky turned one, Kourtney, 45, was ready to up the intensity on her workouts, which she does alongside husband Travis. "It's something my husband and I would always do together, even when we were friends before we were together," she says.
Each week, the couple does three sessions of
strength training
and one to two
Pilates
classes.
Nearly the rest of Kourtney's day is "dedicated to being a mom," she says, so she relishes the time with her husband. And she makes it into a parenting moment, too.
"Every time I'm going into the gym, I set an intention," she says. "Whether I even say it out loud—[sometimes] I say, 'Okay, Mommy's going to get strong,' or whatever. It makes me feel like I'm having a purpose beyond physical appearance."

Currently, Kourtney's still breast feeding Rocky, so she isn't taking any additional vitamins or supplements outside of her typical postnatal routine. But when she stops, she's going to add
Lemme Tone
, Lemme's newest supplement containing methylated B12, apple cider vinegar, and ginger, which debuted on December 29. It's designed to be taken in conjunction with their
"natural GLP-1 supplement,"
Lemme GLP-1
.
"It's formulated to activate your metabolism. It also maintains muscle mass, so you lose fat but not muscle, and helps manage your cravings," she says. "I haven't been able to take it yet, but hopefully will take it when my journey is over...in, like, 10 years!"

She always eats breakfast before workouts.
To fuel herself for a big day, Kourtney makes sure to eat, either a
vegan protein
shake made by Travis or a slice of protein toast with almond butter and sliced bananas.
She also drinks
bone broth
each morning in the carpool line, which has been shown to contain a variety of vitamins and minerals, boost joint health, and aid in digestion.
"That's my superpower!" she says.
Although Kourtney herself isn't vegan, Travis is, so their date nights and Sunday night family dinners are typically meat- and dairy-free.
She's all about feeling strong.
Last year, Kourtney posted a powerful message on
Instagram
about being "kind to yourself" by "keeping calories high with lots of nourishing foods" and "taking time to slowly ease back." She's maintained that mindset throughout her first year postpartum, sharing that she's "more it's health and being strong and having energy and feeling my best more than looking a certain way."

"I just don't let [comments] get to me," she shared. "I am pretty much a homebody—I don't really venture out into the world or see what people are saying. I feel good with my husband. He compliments me. But also just myself, I feel good."
Part of her motivation, she says, is her four children. "Being a good role model to my own kids is really important to me," she says. "The self-talk that I'm saying to myself, it has a reflection on my kids."

Would you risk everything to fulfill your fantasies? That's the premise of
Nicole Kidman's
newest film
Babygirl
, where
the 57-year-old stars as a high-powered CEO who has an affair with a much younger intern.
There are all kinds of power dynamics explored in the movie, and naturally, things get pretty intense. (Nicole even had to pause filming at times because she didn't “want to orgasm any more,” according to
The Sun
.)
But while you’re checking out Nicole onscreen, it’s hard to miss how fit she looks right now. So what does Nicole do for her workouts? Here’s what she’s shared.
Nicole likes to ‘mix up’ her routine.
Nicole is all about keeping her workouts fresh. “With fitness, I try not to be too strict with it and mix it up to make sure it stays fun,” the Oscar winner told the
Los Angeles Times
in 2014.
She’s a fan of all kinds of training, especially with husband
Keith Urban
and their kids Sunday and Faith. (She also shares children Bella and Connor with ex
Tom Cruise
.)

“I run, ride my bike, do yoga—whatever I can do and wherever I am in the world,” Nicole said.  “We try to exercise as a family, which makes it much easier to squeeze in among everything else and, of course, much more enjoyable.”
She loves exercising outdoors.
Nicole has raved about doing a slew of workouts outside, telling
Byrdie
that she likes to go for a run, hike, or swim with her kids before going to work.
She doesn’t mind colder water, either. “That, for me, is how I just stay connected to this planet, you know?” she said. "I love the ocean. I go in all the time."
She’s also into horseback riding:

She has an ‘epic’ lower body workout.
But Nicole still hits the gym sometimes, too. Exhibit A: In July, Nicole's
A Family Affair
co-star
Joey King
shared details about Nicole’s go-to butt workout, and it sounds intense.
"She taught me the most epic, awful butt workout I've ever learned in my life. It was so intense," Joey said on
The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon
. "I was like, 'I'm a youngster. I can hang. I'm young, and I'm agile.' I thought I could hang, but I couldn't hang."
According to Joey, the workout features  “all these
donkey kicks
and the
rainbows
and the
fire hydrants
.”
“But you have to keep your leg in the air for, like, 12 years,” she added. “It's so hard.”
Go Nicole!

Meghan Trainor
is feeling the holiday spirit. The "All About That Bass" singer has been all across the country performing as part of iHeart Radio’s Jingle Ball, and has been showcasing some seriously cool looks in the process.
There’s Meghan in a glittery mini skirt with matching boots and a red bra top, Meghan in an all-white mini skirt outfit with a corset top, and the 30-year-old in sparkly briefs with a red faux fur jacket and matching hat. She’s posted a ton about her performances on
Instagram
, and there’s one consistent theme that keeps coming up in the comments: People can’t stop talking about how fit she looks right now.
“Amazing legs,” one person wrote, while another joked that Meghan is in her “hot mom era.”
Of course, Meghan has made it clear that she doesn’t sleep on her fitness. Here’s what she’s shared about her go-to workout routine.
Lifting weights has ‘changed’ her life.
Meghan has been grinding it out at the gym recently, although she doesn’t go every day. “I try to go three times a week of lifting weights,” she recently shared on
Today
. “I didn’t know lifting weights would change my life so much. I was, like, dying, trying to run on the treadmill, and it made me swollen.”

Meghan said that lifting has given her more energy, joking that she can now lift her children “up like a dumbbell.” (Meghan shares kids Riley and Barry with husband Daryl Sabara.)
She got into shape ahead of her most recent tour.
It was important to Meghan to feel healthy ahead of her Timeless Tour, which wrapped up in October.
“I’m feeling fit. I’ve never been so fit,” she told
People
in March.  “I already told my household. I was like, ‘I am training for the Olympics, okay?’ I want to train and eat clean, and feel good when I’m dancing and singing. I don’t wanna be so winded, because right now, I’m winded.”
She previously lost weight after giving birth.
Meghan was the “heaviest I’d ever been” after giving birth to her son Riley, 3. “I just wasn't feeling great,” she told
Entertainment Tonight Canada
in 2022. “I've never had stitches, so to have this C-section scar, I was in a really dark place, and I wanted to be in a great place for my son.”

Why Trust Us?
You've heard for years that
sitting
is the new smoking.
Sitting all day has been linked to a slew of health issues, including
cardiovascular disease
and
type 2 diabetes
. It can also mess with your muscles and mobility over time. But if you have a desk job, you're kind of stuck.
Luckily, there is something you can do about it, and it involves a popular weight you’ll find at most gyms. Here’s how to work to undo the impact on your muscles from sitting at a desk all day.
Meet the expert
:
Taylor Beebe
, a certified personal trainer in California.
What does sitting do to your body?
In addition to putting you at risk for those health issues we just mentioned and more, sitting does a number on your muscles and joints.

“When you sit all day, especially if you are in front of a computer screen, we are in hip flexion,” explains
Taylor Beebe
, a certified personal trainer in California. “This can lead to the feeling of 'tight' hips, especially in the front of our body.”
If you’re hunched over a computer screen, you also raise the risk of your back and shoulders being rounded forward, she says.
“In order to counterbalance that, we need an activity that puts us in a position for a neutral spine and hip extension,” Beebe says.
How to reverse the damage.
Beebe says that
kettlebell swings
, which are when you swing a kettlebell from between your knees to about eye level, can help.

“Kettlebell swings are a hip dominant movement that target the posterior chain-glutes, hamstrings, upper, and mid-back,” Beebe says. “When done properly, they teach us to drive our feet through the floor to hit hip extension, in order to find a 'stacked' position where shoulders, hips, knees, ankles, all in line.”
This helps to counteract that folded-up position you sit in all day.
The top of the swing should look like a standing plank, Beebe says.
“When we make sure our entire body is in one long line at the top, we are in full hip extension, which engages our posterior chain, allowing for extension,” she says.
How many reps should I do?
It depends. If you’re new to kettlebell swings, Beebe suggests doing five to 10 reps at a time as a “movement snack” to get some movement into your body and your blood flowing. You can build up your reps from there.

Proper form is important.
If you’ve never done kettlebell swings in the past, it’s important to focus on your form. “Make sure you have a strong
deadlift
and
plank
—those are the two foundational movements that make up the kettlebell swing,” Beebe says.
You’ll want to start with the bell in front of you, tilting it towards your body before you hike it back, she says. “Root your feet into the ground as you drive your hips forward, allowing the bell to 'float' at the top.”

She also suggests using your breath to power the movement. “Inhale to pull it back, exhale as your feet push into the floor,” Beebe says.
Whether you have a kettlebell at home or like to hit up your gym after work, adding some swings to the mix after your workday could help keep your joints feeling more comfortable over time.

Heart disease
is the
leading cause
of death for men and women in the U.S., making it important to have on your radar.
While research has consistently found that eating a
healthy diet
and
being active
can lower your cardiovascular disease risk, a new study suggests even little tweaks to your fitness can have a big impact.
Given that many people struggle to work out due to jam-packed schedules, the findings are definitely getting attention. So, what did the study find and how much exercise are we talking? Here’s what you need to know.
Meet the experts
:
Rigved Tadwalkar, MD
, a consultative cardiologist and medical director of the Cardiac Rehabilitation Center at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA;
Dor Lotan, MD
, advanced heart failure cardiologist at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center
What did the study find?
The study, which was published in
the British Journal of Sports Medicine
, analyzed data from more than 103,000 adults who participated in the UK Biobank, a long-term biomedical database. The participants, who had an average age of 61, wore an activity tracker for a week straight between 2013 and 2015.
The researchers looked at the activity tracker data to see which participants had periods of vigorous intermittent lifestyle physical activity (VILPA), or short bursts of
high intensity exercise
, during their day.

The researchers discovered that female participants who didn’t follow a formal exercise routine and recorded an average of 3.4 minutes of those activity bursts a day were 45% less likely to have any kind of major adverse cardiovascular events like heart attack and stroke compared to women who didn’t have any of those activity bursts during their day.
They were also 51% less likely to have a heart attack, and 67% less likely to have heart failure.
“Vigorous intermittent lifestyle physical activity may be a promising physical activity target for cardiovascular disease prevention, particularly in women unable or not willing to engage in formal exercise,” the researchers wrote in the conclusion.
Are the results applicable to Americans?
The study was conducted on residents in the UK, but scientists usually say that results from research on that population can apply to Americans (and vice versa).

“Cardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. As such, identifying accessible, sustainable interventions is vital for public health,” says
Rigved Tadwalkar, MD
, a consultative cardiologist and medical director of the Cardiac Rehabilitation Center at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA.
What's the takeaway from the findings?
The researchers found that even shorter amounts of small bursts of activity could have an impact on cardiovascular disease risk in people who don’t work out regularly.
For example, doing these short bursts of activity for as little as 1.2 minutes a day was linked to a 30% lower risk of all major adverse cardiovascular events, including a 40% lower risk of heart failure and 33% lower risk of heart attack.

The findings “align with the growing evidence supporting cumulative benefits from brief, regular physical activity,” says
Dor Lotan, MD
, advanced heart failure cardiologist at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center. “Previous
studies
have [also] shown that even ‘incidental’ activity, like multiple short walking breaks, significantly reduces cardiovascular risk over time,” he adds.
Easy Ways To Add Short Bursts Of Activity During The Day
The study didn’t track exactly what people did when they had these short bursts of activity, but Tadwalkar says it’s important to focus on making “small, deliberate changes” to your everyday activities.
That can include:
Taking the stairs at a brisk pace.
Walking fast when you take a phone call vs. sitting while you talk.
Carrying groceries instead of using a cart.
Doing jumping jacks or squats throughout your day.
Doing household chores at a fast pace.
All of this “can contribute to these short bursts of vigorous activity,” Tadwalkar says. The overall goal is to get your heart rate up, which may make you feel a little winded, but not gasping for air. “So, take a quick walk today, and make it a habit. Your heart will thank you,” Lotan says.

If you're on the hunt for new butt exercises and glute workouts to grow your backside, we can't blame you. The benefits of a toned booty go far deeper than aesthetics.
Strong glutes
are essential for maintaining mobility and reducing the risk of injury as we age.
“Glute strength is crucial for stabilizing your hips and supporting your lower back, which helps you move better and stay pain-free,” says Leigh Taylor Weissman, CPT, a personal trainer and founder of the Leigh Taylor Method. Whether sitting, standing, or working out, engaging your glutes is essential for overall strength and stability.
Ready for serious booty gains? It’s time to level up your routine with the 17 most effective glute exercises for women, according to trainers.
Meet the experts:
Leigh Taylor Weissman
, CPT, is a personal trainer, glute specialist, and founder of the
Leigh Taylor Method
.
Kehinde Anjorin
, CFSC, NCSF, is a functional strength coach, personal trainer, and founder of
PowerInMovement
and online streaming fitness service
The Power Method
.
Benefits Of Butt Exercises
As we age, muscle mass and bone density naturally decline, which can expose a body to injury and pain, says Weissman.
Strength training
helps counteract this loss, and targeting your glutes is a key part of that strategy. “Having strong glutes further protects the body from injury and pain as its main job is to support and stabilize your hips, which control knee and ankle movement, as well as your entire trunk from neck to pelvis.”
Strong glutes do more than just power you through workouts, though. They're key players in everyday movements like sitting, standing, walking, and even climbing stairs, says Kehinde Anjorin, CFSC, NCSF, a certified functional strength coach, personal trainer, and founder of PowerInMovement. “They play a pivotal role in hip and lower back stability, and they’re also your biggest hip extensors,” she says.
Strong glutes also aid in
hinging and squatting
, while keeping your back strong and pelvis stabilized, which helps protect the lower back from injury, says Anjorin. Plus, if you’re spending most of your day sitting at a desk (hello, same!), strong glutes are crucial for offsetting the effects of prolonged sitting. Working the glutes helps realign the body out of a flexed position and can help correct imbalances caused by sitting for long periods, says Weissman.
To maximize your
booty gains
, variety in your movements is key, says Anjorin. While
squats
will always be a staple, incorporating different exercises will target your glutes from all angles, helping you build, strengthen, and tone a well-rounded peach. And, BTW, if you're looking for a fun and structured way to mix things up, try our
Glute Gains Challenge
, designed to help you hit every angle and level up your glute game.

How To Perform Butt Exercises Safely
Now that you have the 411 on why working your glutes is so important, let’s get into training specifics. These exercises will help you switch up your routine, build strength,
and
see results.
Time:
15 minutes |
Equipment:
resistance band
and
dumbbells
optional |
Good for:
Glutes
Instructions:
Choose at least three exercises from the list below. For each exercise, you'll perform 3 sets of 8–12 reps total, resting for 30 seconds between each set. After completing one set of one exercise, move on to the next. Once you’ve completed all your selected exercises, rest for 1 minute, then repeat the entire circuit two more times, for a total of 3 rounds.
Pro tip:
If you can easily perform more than 12 reps with your current weight, it’s time to increase the weight for a greater challenge. That last rep should be a fight, but doable without sacrificing form. Need more help deciding what size dumbbell to pick up?

17 Best Butt Exercises
1. Mini Band Kickback
Why it rocks:
This is a great exercise to work the glutes in extension one side at a time, says Weissman. “By keeping the hips static and allowing the moving leg to extend away from the body and toward the ceiling, you’ll isolate the gluteus maximus and feel that burn.”
How to:
On hands and knees, put one end of mini band around your right foot, positioning the other end on left thigh, just above the knee.
While keeping your core engaged, slowly contract glutes and kick right leg behind you  until it's straight and level with your spine.
At full extension, squeeze glutes for an extra second. With control,  lower  it back down to the ground.
That’s 1 rep.
Complete all reps, then switch sides and repeat.
Pro tip:
Weissman suggests pulsing the leg at the top of the movement to increase time under tension and maximize the burn.

2. Alternating Reverse Lunge
How to:
Stand with feet shoulder-width apart and arms at sides. (Option to complete with bodyweight or hold dumbbells, as shown.)
Inhale and step one foot back, bending both knees about 90 degrees to a lunge position, maintaining  upright posture and engaging core.
Step back foot forward to meet other foot,  returning to starting position. Repeat on other side.
That’s 1 rep.
3. Bulgarian Split Squat
Why it rocks:
This is one of Weissman’s favorite glute moves for a reason. “You’ll get a lot of bang for that brutal buck,” she says. It targets the lower glute max and glute medius, while also torching the gluteus minimus when you add slight rotation to the “working hip,” she says.
How to:
Stand on right foot, with left knee bent and foot off the ground.
Bend right knee, extending left leg down until knee is a few inches off the ground, keeping arms in front for balance. (Feel free to use a block or ball as a marker of where knee should land.)
Slowly return to starting position.
That's 1 rep.
Complete all reps, then switch sides and repeat.
4. Clam Shell
Why it rocks:
Clam shells are another great move for hitting the gluteus medius and minimus, says Weissman. Another perk? You’ll also target your inner and outer thighs and engage your pelvic floor.
How to:
Lie on side with legs stacked and knees bent at a 45-degree angle, mini resistance band looped above knees.
Use top arm to keep you stable and keep hip bones stacked on top of one another.
Engage core to stabilize spine and pelvis, keep feet touching, and raise upper knee as high as you can without shifting hips or pelvis. Keep your lower leg on the floor.
Pause, and then return upper leg to the starting position on the ground.
That’s 1 rep.
Complete all reps, then switch sides and repeat.
Pro tip:
The mini resistance band around your thighs increases resistance and adds a major burn but the exercise can be done without a band, too, says Weissman.
5. Hip Thrust
Why it rocks:
Hip thrusts are the same concept as a glute bridge, but on an elevated surface, says Weissman. “This allows for the glutes to go through their full range of motion and is the most effective exercise for glute growth, especially for the gluteus maximus.”
How to:
Place upper back (lower scapula) against an exercise ball or the edge of a bench (in the center of the bench) with your knees bent and feet slightly wider than shoulder-distance apart.
Squeeze glutes, engage core, and lift hips until they are in line with shoulders and knees. Keep ribs down (don’t arch back) and chin slightly tucked or head at neutral.
Pause, then return to the starting position.
That’s 1 rep.
6. Step-Up
Why it rocks:
This move works the glutes and includes a stabilizing challenge. “By adding a stabilizing element, you take some of the load away from the glute medius, however it will target the lower glute maximus much more effectively,” says Weissman.
How to:
Stand facing a box, step, or stairs, and hold dumbbells at sides.
Place left foot on the bench, and keep right foot on the floor.
Pushing through left foot, step up until you're in a standing position at the top of the bench. Drive right knee up until it forms a 90-degree angle.
Pause, then reverse the motion to return to starting position.
That’s 1 rep.
Complete all reps, then switch sides and repeat.
7. Walking Lunges
Why it rocks: “
A walking lunge is the best exercise to mimic your gait (walk) and target the glutes to support that movement,” says Weissman. “You can work so many muscles that help stabilize the hips and pelvis while performing it, and there’s an aerobic component that you may not get in other exercises.”
How to:
Stand with feet together holding a pair of weights at shoulder height, elbows bent in front of body.
Step right foot forward and bend knees to lower down into a lunge, stopping when both legs form 90-degree angles.
Press through the right heel to stand and step left foot forward, lowering into a lunge.
That's one rep.
Continue alternating sides for the desired number of reps.
Pro tip:
Walking lunges are a great workout finisher to totally toast the muscle, says Weissman. “You are alternating the load from one hip to the other, giving you a small but very necessary ‘rest’ or reset on one side.”
8. Single-Leg Deadlift
Why it rocks:
This is a golden butt exercise for a reason: It works the gluteus maximus and gluteus medius, says Weissman. Plus, this move is a killer way to improve your stability and train unilateral strength, she says.
How to:
Stand on left leg with right leg slightly back behind body and resting on the floor, right hand holding a dumbbell, and left arm extended at side.
Engage core and slowly hinge the hips back, lifting right leg straight behind you and lowering torso toward floor until both are parallel to ceiling and right hand/dumbbell is almost touching floor. The emphasis should be on the hip hinge and leg elevation, rather than focusing on the torso lowering—that will happen naturally!
Drive through right heel to return to the starting position.
That’s 1 rep.
Complete all reps, then switch sides and repeat.
9. Supported Single-Leg Deadlift
Why it rocks:
This move primarily targets one leg, but still involves both sides of the body. The back leg helps stabilize the front leg and hip, says Weissman.
While single-leg deadlifts primarily target one leg, they can still involve both sides of the body, Weissman says. The back leg helps stabilize the front leg and hip, making it somewhat bilateral in nature.
How to:
Stand on left leg with a weight in right hand, arm extended straight and weight in front of thighs, palm facing toward body, left arm by side and right leg straight and a few feet behind body with heel high (like a kickstand).
Keep a slight bend in the left knee, then lean forward, hinging at the hips with a flat back while lowering the weight toward the floor.
Drive into the left heel to return to the standing position.
That’s 1 rep.
Complete all reps, then switch sides and repeat.
Pro tip:
To increase the challenge on the working leg, you can adjust the weight distribution by slightly elevating the heel of your opposite foot, shifting more load onto the targeted side.
10. Banded Glute Bridge
Why it rocks:
Glute bridges are one of Weissman's favorite exercises for glutes because they work the muscles in the concentric phase. “The glutes love the shortened position, that tight squeeze you feel when you clench them, and loading the hips in this capacity will be a winning ticket to the gains.”
How to:
Loop a resistance band around the mid-thighs, then lie on back with knees bent, feet flat on the floor, and arms resting by sides.
Engaging core, drive through heels to raise hips toward the ceiling—squeezing glutes and maintaining tension on the band the whole time.
Hold the position for 1 second before lowering to tap hips to the floor.
That's 1 rep.
11. Glute Bridge March
Why it rocks:
The glute bridge is a great move for working on your hip extension, says Weissman. You’ll also feel a little burn in your abs since maintaining the bridge requires core stability and strength.
How to:
Lie  on back with knees bent and feet flat on the floor, hip-width apart.
Engage core, then press into heels and squeeze glutes to raise hips until body forms a straight line from knees to shoulders.
Lift right knee toward chest. Pause, then lower right foot.
Repeat with the other leg.
That's 1 rep.
12. Bodyweight Squat
Why it rocks:
This variation without added weight is great for beginners to perfect form. It still works all three muscles of the glutes.
How to:
Stand with feet shoulder-width apart and arms at sides.
Push hips back and bend knees to lower into a squat, lowering until thighs are at least parallel with the floor.
Press through heels and push back to stand.
That's 1 rep.
13. Goblet Squat
Why it rocks:
The goblet squat is another killer booty move because it works the hips in flexion and abduction which targets all three muscles of the glutes, says Weissman. The added weight also adds more tension to the glutes as the hips have to travel back and hinge to execute, she says.
How to:
Stand with feet shoulder-width apart and hold a weight in front of chest, elbows pointing toward the floor.
Push hips back and bend knees to lower into a squat.
Push back to starting position.
That's 1 rep.
14. Single-Leg Box Squat
Why it rocks:
A unilateral squat is an advanced exercise since it requires balance, stability, and coordination, while simultaneously torching your glutes, says Weissman. It’s also a knee-dominant move, so you can ease into it with a higher box to nail the movement pattern and build strength, she says.
How to:
Stand facing away from a box (or chair) with weight in left foot, right foot hovering, and arms at sides.
Engage core, bend left knee, and push hips back to sink down into a single-leg squat until butt touches box, simultaneously extending arms out straight in front of body and right foot out slightly for balance.
Once butt taps the box, press through your left foot to return to standing position.
That's 1 rep.
Complete all reps, then switch sides and repeat.
15. Curtsy Lunge
Why it rocks:
A curtsy lunge works the entire glute maximus, says Weissman. “What makes this exercise unique is that the moving leg travels behind the hip in the frontal plane following the glutes' natural fibers. By moving the leg behind and to the side of the body, you’re working the front hip in a way that is unlike most other glute building movements.”
How to:
Stand tall with feet under hips and arms clasped in front of chest.
Engage core, lift yur right foot off the floor, and take a big step back and to the outside of left foot.
Then, bend at the knees until right knee taps the floor behind left foot.
Drive through feet to reverse the movement and return to starting position.
That's 1 rep.
16. Lateral Lunge With Reach
Why it rocks:
This move works the trio of glute muscles, and is another frontal plane exercise that helps create a well-rounded routine, says Weissman. “When designing a routine, having exercises that work in multiple planes of motion, front to back, and side to side, will ensure you are targeting all the major muscles in the glutes.”
How to:
Stand with feet wider than shoulder-width apart, hands at side.
With right hand, reach down toward our foot, lowering yur body until left knee is bent 90 degrees.
Immediately repeat on the other side.
That's 1 rep.
17. Romanian Deadlift
Why it rocks:
A Romanian deadlift is a bilateral hip-dominant exercise and one of Weissman’s top moves for glute gains. “This is one of the big lifts that you can load up, which is an important variable when growing the glutes.”
How to:
Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, knees slightly bent, holding a pair of weights in front of thighs, palms facing body.
Keeping knees slightly bent, press hips back as you hinge at hips and lower weights toward the floor.
Squeeze glutes to return to standing.
That's 1 rep.
How To Build A Bigger Butt
If your goal is to
grow
your glutes, Weissman says there are three non-negotiable moves for a bigger booty:
hip thrusts, Romanian deadlifts, and squats
. Prioritize these three moves as a means to build a booty  since they are the ones you can load with the most weight, she says.
The
hip thrust
is one of the few exercises where you can significantly load the glutes in the shortened position (when the glutes are contracted or squeezed), says Weissman. “Here you will mostly be targeting the middle gluteus maximus and some gluteus medius, especially if you are performing the exercises with external rotation (with your hips open and feet pointed heels in and toes out).”
Romanian deadlifts
are another maximizing glute move because they’re a hip dominant exercise that will target the gluteus maximus and medius, says Weissman. “Unlike the hip thrust, this exercise will largely hit the lower portion of your glutes, and work them in the lengthened position, when they are stretched.”
Lastly, the
squat
is another fantastic compound lift to load the lower gluteus maximus in the lengthened position as you move into the end range (the deep portion of the squat), says Weissman. “Pushing the hips back into flexion and letting the torso fold slightly will load more of those booty fibers as you bend the knees to get depth.”
Want to make butt exercises more effective? You must progressively overload (challenge yourself more) over time, Weissman says. Here are three ways to do that:
Load:
Increase the weight.
Volume:
Increase the number of reps per set (volume).
Time under tension
:
Increase the amount of time spent under the load and holding position.
Finally, if you want a bigger butt, you have to “eat for your goals,” says Weissman. Strength training is the number one priority, but without the diet to support the work, your muscles won’t have the fuel needed to grow.  Prioritize fueling up with carbs pre-workout and
eating protein after your lifts
to ensure you’re getting enough nutrients to support the work you’re putting in.
What are the glute muscles?
Here's a quick posterior anatomy primer. Your glutes include three distinct muscles: gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, and gluteus minimus.
Gluteus maximus:
The largest muscle in the body and provides most of the shape of the buttocks, says Anjorin. It also keeps you upright when sitting and standing, and acts as the
lower-body power generator
allowing you to run, jump, squat and extend or rotate your leg outward and backwards.
Gluteus mediu
s:
The second glute muscle in command behind the gluteus maximus, and sits between the gluteus maximus and gluteus minimus. Its main job is to stabilize the pelvis, but also promotes movement of the hip and upper leg including hip
abduction
, hip external rotation, and hip internal rotation, says Anjorin.
Gluteus minimu
s:
The smallest glute muscle, located right below the gluteus medius. “This muscle helps to produce several movements of the hips and legs including
hip extension
, hip internal rotation, and hip abduction,” says Anjorin

Why Trust Us?
This 20-minute leg and butt workout is part of the
Women's Health
30-Day Workout Challenge
. For this part of the exercise program, all you need is a mat and dumbbells to strengthen and tone your calves, thighs, and glutes with 15 strength exercises.
I've designed this to be an
AMRAP workout
, meaning your goal is to do as many reps as possible (with proper form!) for each move in the time allotted, rest as indicated, and then continue on to the next exercise. It's intended to be a low-impact, lower-body workout, but just because your dumbbells might be lighter than usual, don't think you're getting off easy. You'll definitely
feel
this workout the next day—but in a good way!
Ahead, you'll find a breakdown of each move in this workout program, including instructions and a visual exercise demo.

Why Trust Us?
There’s nothing more satisfying than
glute gains
. While targeting your
glutes
can help
sculpt your booty
, it does way more than perk up your peach. "[The glutes are] a major stabilizer, and also the biggest muscle in the body," says Leigh Weissman, CPT, a personal trainer, nutrition coach, and glute specialist. "The glutes control a lot of your pelvic function and the hips."
That means your
glutes
help you do everything from walk, sit, and bend throughout your day. And, if you work them effectively, building strength in the glutes can even translate to a boost in your athletic performance. Stronger glutes help you sprint faster and turn quicker, according to Weissman. Meanwhile, in
yoga
, the glutes facilitate balance in different poses, she says. Plus, when your glutes are strong, you can better strengthen and
protect your back
,
hips
, and
core
—all of which are key players in
balance
and stability. Regardless of your fitness level, everyone can benefit from stronger, more toned glutes (and do it right at home, to boot).
Meet the experts:
Leigh Weissman,
CPT, is a glute specialist, nutrition coach, and founder of Leigh Taylor Method.
Suki Clements, CPT, RYT
, is a New York City-based yoga teacher and former professional dancer.
What muscles do you want to work to get all these benefits, exactly? The gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, and gluteus minimus muscles along with a slew of other smaller muscles, like the piriformis (located about where the heel of your hand lands if you put it in the back pocket of your jeans), are all part of your behind—and we’ve included  moves to target each and everyone one of them.
How To Work Your Glutes At Home
The key to getting in a good butt workout at home (and reaping all of these full-body benefits) is to move slowly and with control so that you actually engage  your glute muscles—and
don't stress out your lower back
. To keep the focus on your butt, engage your core and exhale through the challenging part of every exercise. While many of the best glute exercises can be done at home using just bodyweight, adding resistance bands or dumbbells is a great way to increase the challenge and tone the glutes more effectively.
How many days a week should I work my glutes?
As long as you're taking time to fully recover from each workout, you can work your butt up to three times a week. Some level of soreness is okay, especially if you’re starting to work your glutes for the first time in a while (or ever). But, you want to make sure you’re giving your glutes time to rest, since that’s when your muscles actually do their growing. Stretching, foam rolling, hydrating, sleeping, and eating well are absolutely key to give your muscles what they need to come back stronger.
Use the 15 trainer-recommended exercises below to create your own butt workout at home. All you need is a
mini resistance band
and a set of
dumbbells
!
Time:
20 minutes |
Equipment:
resistance bands, dumbbells |
Good for:
glutes
Instructions:
Choose up to five of the exercises below. Complete the indicated number of reps for each, then rest for 15 seconds and continue on to the next. Once you've completed all five exercises, rest for one minute, then repeat the entire circuit twice more for a total of three sets.
1
Standing Glute Kickback
Muscles worked:
Gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, hamstrings, calves, and core
Why it rocks:
This move isolates one side so you can really feel the burn. Working one side allows you to recognize and fix strength imbalances, says Weissman.
How to:
Place a resistance band around both legs a few inches above your ankles (
WH
fitness editor
Talene Appleton
recs
these
mini bands for moves like this).
Start with weight on left foot and right leg long behind body with toes pointed and resting on floor.
Bend left knee slightly and hinge at hips to lower torso forward.
Clasp hands in front of body. This is your starting position.
From here, engage right glutes to kick straight right leg back and up until nearly parallel with floor. Slowly and with control, reverse the movement to return to start.
That's one rep.
Perform 10 to 12 per side.
Pro tip:
Engage core throughout the movement to prevent lower-back strain and keep the emphasis on glutes. Use a looped resistance band just above your knees to level this one up.
2
Supported Single-Leg Deadlift
Muscles worked:
Hamstrings, upper back, core, glutes
Why it rocks:
"This
deadlift
variation allows you to load the working glutes and create stability with the other leg, says Weissman. "That helps create more tension and isolates what you want to target."
How to:
Stand with left leg forward and holding a dumbbell in right hand, palm facing thigh.
Take a step back with right foot and lift heel.
Keeping left leg slightly bent but back flat, hinge at hips to lower weight towards floor.
Drive into left heel to return to the standing position. That’s 1 rep. Perform 10 to 12 per side.
Pro tip:
Keeping a slight bend in the knee of your working leg really fires up the quad and glute muscles.

3
Hip Thrust
Muscles worked:
Glutes and hamstrings
Why it rocks:
Working the hips in this position gives you the biggest strength boost, says Weissman. Science is there to support it, too, according to a
Journal of Sports Science & Medicine
study.
How to:
Sit with feet flat on the floor in front of a couch or stable chair.
Place forearms flat on surface so elbows point back and fingers point forward.
Lift seat up off floor and walk feet out until planted slightly beyond knees. This is your starting position.
Push through heels and engage glutes to extend hips up until body forms a straight line from shoulders to knees.
Reverse the movement to return to start.
That's one rep.
Perform 10 to 12.
Pro tip:
To maximize glute engagement, press knees slightly outward throughout the movement. For an extra challenge, place a looped mini-band just above your knees or add a weight at the hips.
4
Good Morning
Muscles worked:
Hamstrings, erector spinae, glutes
Why it rocks:
This move is a great way to feel a stretch in the glute muscles, says Weissman. To take it up a notch, she suggests adding resistance with a band or
dumbbell
.
How to:
Start standing with feet hips-width distance apart (or slightly wider) and hands clasped behind your head.
Bend knees slightly, engage core, draw shoulders back, and keep neck long, then hinge at hips to push seat back while lowering chest forward until parallel to floor.
Keeping weight in heels, slowly reverse the movement to return to start.
That's 1 rep.
Perform 10 to 12 reps.
Pro tip:
Hold a dumbbell behind neck to increase the intensity.

5
Romanian Deadlift
Muscles worked:
Lower back, glutes, hamstrings, calves
Why it rocks:
A RDL is a great way to level up from a Good Morning because it adds resistance and intensity with the dumbbells, says Weissman.
How to:
Standing with feet shoulder width apart, holding dumbbells in hands with palms facing thighs.
Keeping back straight, hinge at the hips and focus on sending hips and butt back as you lower the dumbbells toward the ground.
Engage glutes and rise back to standing, locking hips out at the top.
That's 1 rep.
Perform 10 to 12 reps.
Pro tip:
Keep the dumbbells close to your legs and maintain a flat back throughout the entire movement to reduce strain on your lower back.
6
Banded Glute Bridge
Muscles worked:
Glutes, hamstrings, core
Why it rocks:
This has all the benefits of a bodyweight glute bridge, but you also engage the hips more with the band.
How to:
Wrap a resistance band around thighs and lie faceup with knees bent and feet on the floor about a foot away from butt (Appleton says
these
booty bands are her favorites to use for this move).
Brace core, then press into heels and squeeze glutes to lift hips up toward ceiling while pushing upper back into floor.
Pause in this position and expand the band by pressing knees apart.
Reverse the movement and return to start.
That's 1 rep.
Perform 10 to 12 reps.
Pro tip:
To make this more challenging, hold a dumbbell on top of hips.

7
Banded Clam Shell
Muscles worked:
Gluteus medius
Why it rocks:
Clamshells are a highly effective move to activate the glutes and specifically target the gluteus medius using just a resistance band.
How to:
Start lying on right side on a mat with upper body propped up on right forearm, right elbow below right shoulder.
Stack left foot over right with legs bent at 90 degrees and heels in line with glutes.
Place left hand on top hip. This is your starting position.Without moving hips or disconnecting feet, engage outer left glutes to drive left knee straight up toward ceiling.
Reverse the movement to return to start.
That's 1 rep.
Perform 10 to 12 reps, then switch sides and repeat.
Pro tip:
Don’t be afraid to play with tempo here. Practice holding for one to two seconds at the top of the movement, squeezing deep in the glute of the top leg, then slowly lowering to meet the bottom leg.
8
Bulgarian Split Squat
Muscles worked:
Quads, hamstrings, glutes
Why it rocks:
This is one of Weissman's go to exercises for all her clients. "This causes the glute medias to fire up to help stabilize the pelvis," says Weissman.
How to:
Stand in front of a low bench or platform with feet hip-width apart.
Place left foot onto the platform behind you, gently resting the top of the foot to stabilize. The distance between you and the elevated surface can vary depending on your experience and range of motion.
Engage core and glutes and lower down with control. Stop when back knee hovers just off the ground, or as low as is comfortable for your range of motion.
Drive through front foot and squeeze glutes as you stand back up.
That's 1 rep.
Complete 10 to 12 reps, then switch sides and repeat.
9
Curtsy Lunge
Muscles worked:
Quads, glutes, hip abductors
Why it rocks:
"This exercise makes you work in the frontal plane, which is less common for glute moves, says Weissman. That means you're working the muscles at a different angle.
How to:
Start standing with feet wider than hips and hands clasped in front of chest.
Step left foot back, while keeping both hip bones facing forward, and plant it outside of right leg, heel high.
Keeping torso upright, squeeze inner thighs together and lower down until back knee hovers above floor.
Press down into right heel to return to start position. Press through heels to return to standing.
That's 1 rep.
Complete 10 to 12 reps, then switch sides and repeat.
Pro tip:
Hold a dumbbell at chest height to increase the intensity.
10
Glute Kickback
Muscles worked:
Gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, hamstrings, calves, and core
Why it rocks:
This tabletop setup allows your upper body to help with stabilizing your hips while you focus on working the glutes one side at a time.
How to:
Start on all fours with shoulders stacked over wrists and back flat, toes tucked, and knees under hips.
Keep core tight, shoulders and hips square, and foot flexed, then squeeze glute and kick the right knee back in line with the hip.
Reverse the movement to return to start.
That's 1 rep.
Perform 10 to 12 reps, then switch sides and repeat.
Pro tip:
Imagine you're trying to stamp the sole of your foot on the wall behind you and move from the hips, not the lower back.

11
Isometric Banded Glute Bridge
Muscles worked:
Hamstrings, lower back, abs, glutes
Why it rocks:
"This is a good move if you just want to feel what it's like to squeeze the glute and feel that contraction," explains Weissman.
How to:
Lie on back with knees bent and feet on the floor 12 to 16 inches from butt.
Brace core, then press into heels and squeeze glutes to lift hips towards ceiling. Maintain space between chin and chest and keep upper back pressed into floor.
Hold the elevated position with glutes engaged for 5 seconds.
That's 1 rep.
Perform 5 reps.
Pro tip:
When at the top of the position with hips elevated, think about pulling your heels towards your butt. This helps to further engage the glutes.
12
Fire Hydrant
Muscles worked:
Gluteus medius
Why it rocks:
This move works the glute med which is one of the main glute muscles, Weissman notes. She adds that if you want an extra push, you can add resistance bands.
How to:
Start on all fours with shoulders over wrists, hips over knees, and toes planted on the floor.
Keeping right leg bent to 90 degrees, engage core and squeeze through outer right glutes to lift right knee out to the right, until upper leg is parallel to floor (or as close as possible).
Slowly and with control, return leg to starting position.
That's one rep.
Perform 10 to 12 reps, then switch sides and repeat.
Pro tip:
Aim to distribute your weight evenly through each hand, avoiding sinking into your right side when working the left leg, and vice versa.

13
Lateral Lunge with Balance
Muscles worked:
Hamstrings, glutes, quads
Why it rocks:
"This is great for the overall health of your hips," says Weissman. She adds that you can also use this move to measure your progress and see your strength improve over time.
How to:
Stand with feet hip-width apart, hands at sides.
Take a big step to the left, then push hips back, bending left knee and lowering body until left knee is bent to 90 degrees.
Push back to an upright position, lifting left knee up and into the chest.
That's 1 rep.
Perform 10 to 12 reps, then switch sides and repeat.
Pro tip:
Keep weight in heel of bending leg to fire up glutes.
14
Split Squat
Muscles worked:
Quads and glutes
Why it rocks:
This move allows you to work the muscles that help you walk and move in everyday life, says Weissman.
How to:
Start standing with hands at sides or clasped in front of chest and legs staggered so left is forward and right is back with right heel raised.
With torso upright, bend knees and lower until legs both form 90-degree angles.
Press through left foot to return to standing position.
That's 1 rep.
Perform 10 to 12 reps, then switch sides and repeat.
Pro tip:
When in the lowest position, hover back knee off the floor to keep lower body under tension. Hold dumbbells to increase the intensity.

15
Alternating Step Up
Muscles worked:
Quads, hamstrings, glutes
Why it rocks:
You can play with tempo and create multiple variations of this move, says Weissman. "If you're doing it with bodyweight, slowing down that step down is how you get the most bang for your buck."
How to:
Stand with feet hips-width apart in front of an elevated surface or step.
Lift left foot and step onto the elevated surface.
Press into left foot and lift right leg up to chest, lengthening the glute.
Step the right foot back to start and bring the left to meet it.
Then, switch sides and repeat.
That's 1 rep.
Continue alternating for 10 to 12 reps.

How Much Rest Do You Need Between Workouts To Build Muscle? Experts Break Down The Science
How Much Rest Do You Need Between Workouts To Build Muscle? Experts Break Down The Science
It all depends on what kind of workouts you do.

Being competitive has been part of my DNA since
childhood
. In my adult years, I still struggle with putting my natural drive toward intensity to rest, which can be an issue when it comes to workouts. If my legs feel like goo after an
intense lower-body day
, I still want to dive back in the next day and push myself harder. And while scaling back isn’t in my nature, I’ve learned that rest is an essential part of any training routine—after all, it’s when the real magic of
muscle-building
happens.
But how much rest do you need between workouts to
build muscle efficiently
?
There
is
sweet spot to hit when it comes to adequate rest, but unfortunately, it isn’t a one-size-fits-all answer. That said, there are some general parameters to consider based on your fitness goals and the type of workouts you do, says Alexander Rothstein, EdD, an exercise physiologist and educator.
Below, experts explain the factors to consider when planning out your rest days, and why carefully planned recovery time is crucial for reaching your individual fitness goals.
Meet the experts
:
Alexander Rothstein, EdD
, exercise physiologist and program coordinator of Exercise Science at New York Institute of Technology;
Steven K. Malin, PhD
, a researcher and associate professor in the Department of Kinesiology and Health at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School;
Hans Haverkamp, PhD
,
an associate professor of nutrition and exercise physiology at Washington State University
What It Takes For Your Muscles To Heal And Grow
It may seem counterintuitive, but rest is an essential part of
building muscle and strength
.
“When we’re exercising or doing any positive stress for the body, what we’re really doing is breaking down muscle tissue,” Rothstein says. But your body needs rest to allow muscle fiber tears to recover and actually support tissue growth—a process known as
hypertrophy
, Rothstein says.   “The rest period gives the opportunity for all the nutrients to arrive [to the muscles], and for the actual building to occur,” he says.
This repair and adaptation can’t occur "if the muscles are not allowed sufficient recovery," adds Hans Haverkamp, PhD, an associate professor of nutrition and exercise physiology. Meaning, your muscles won't grow, even though you're putting in the work.
Proper nutrition
, including
adequate protein
, is also crucial to this process, says Steven K. Malin, PhD, a kinesiology researcher and educator. Protein provides the essential building blocks, or
amino acids
, that your body uses to repair and rebuild muscle tissue, making it a key player in optimizing recovery and muscle growth.

How Much Rest You Need Between Workouts, Based On Your Goals
Again, there are a lot of variables that go into how much rest you need, including the type of workouts you do, your experience level, and even your
sleep quality
.
But there are some overarching recovery recs that exercise specialists usually recommend. “Typically 48 hours is advised when following moderate- to
high-intensity programs
,” Malin says. “The more intense the programs, the more time needed.”
In some cases, like a really hard leg day, you may need 72 hours to rest that particular muscle group, Malin says. But experts stress that there is some variation here.
If you're trying to build muscle…
Experts recommend resting 48 to 72 hours between workouts targeting the same muscle group.
Muscle-building usually involves
heavy lifting
—that is, more weight but fewer reps. “The general recommendation for rest is 48 to 72 hours before working the same muscle group again,” Rothstein says. “That means you would hit each muscle group twice per week.”
If it’s a particularly tough workout, Rothstein recommends resting two to three days before targeting the same muscle group again.
But try to listen to your body here: "If you are still noticeably sore two days following a challenging day of
resistance training
, adding another day or two of recovery might be beneficial," Havercamp adds.
If you’re doing
bodyweight exercises
, like
planks
and
squats
without additional weights or resistance, you don’t necessarily need to rest that long before targeting the same muscle group, Rothstein says.
If you’re lifting heavy weights, your workout and rest schedule may look like:
Leg day
Arms day
Core day
Leg day
Arms day
Core day
Active recovery or rest day
If you're training for an endurance event…
Experts recommend alternating between high and low intensity workout days and incorporating at least one day of total rest or active recovery.
Endurance events are a little different. If you’re
training for a marathon
or long cycling event, Rothstein says you can do more active exercise days in a row. “I would just alternate high-intensity training days with lower-intensity days,” he says.
You also may want to mix up your workouts to allow you to still challenge your cardiovascular system, but to give certain muscle groups a break. “Some people will train six days a week and do nothing on day seven, or do an active recovery day, like Pilates or yoga where it’s less intensity but still recovery,” Rothstein says.
If you’re training for a running endurance race, that may look like:
Distance run at a slower pace
Running workout at race pace
Distance run at a slower pace
Cycling or swimming workout
Running workout at race pace
Distance run at a slower pace
Pilates class
If you mostly take group workout classes...
Experts recommend taking a rest day at least every three to four days of consecutive classes as well as mixing up the type of workout classes you’re doing.
If you’re into group workout classes, you’re unlikely to need as much recovery as if you were doing something like heavy lifting, Rothstein says. “You can do more days, and more days in a row,” he says. “You can also take a rest day after three to four classes in a row.”
Rothstein just recommends mixing up your workout classes to try to target different muscle groups. (Bonus: This also keeps things fresh.)
That can look like:
Indoor cycling class
Dance-based class
Barre
class
HIIT class
Yoga class or stretching
Indoor cycling class
Pilates class
Signs You’re Not Getting Enough Rest
There are a few key symptoms you’re not giving your body the rest it needs. “Fatigue and drowsiness throughout the day is a primary example of this,” Malin says. You may also feel irritable, and you might feel less motivated to workout than usual, he says.
Dealing with constant nagging injuries can also be a sign you’re not resting enough, Rothstein says.
"Listen to your body, notice when your overall mood state worsens, and when your irritability ‘fuse’ gets shorter and your mood state becomes more volatile," Havercamp says. "These are signs that you might need to back off on training volume and intensity for a few days."
Rest Versus Active Recovery
The terms “rest” and “
active recovery
” are sometimes used interchangeably, but they’re not the same thing. Rest can mean light movement throughout the day, Malin says. “Rest doesn’t mean sit down and don’t do any physical activity,” he says. “Rest really is getting at the idea of minimizing strenuous physical activity.” (But "total rest" does mean basically sitting on your butt.)
Active recovery is a little different. “Active recovery usually includes light movement,” Malin says. Here are a few examples of each.
Total rest
Watching Netflix
Taking a nap
Reading on your couch
Active recovery
Doing a light bike ride
Going for an easy walk
Taking a beginner yoga class
There’s also something called passive recovery, where you might do something like get a
massage
, do a
cold plunge
, or use
compression gear
, Malin says. “Passive recovery is designed where the person is not moving much, but rather efforts are made to oppose aspects of exercise,” he says.
How To Get The Most Out Of Rest Days
It’s easy to think of rest and recovery as unimportant compared to your workouts, but experts say it’s important to consider them as part of your overall training plan. “I definitely would include these as part of a planned, can’t-give-it-up aspect of individual workouts,” Rothstein says.
On days when you’re pressed for time, he even suggests shortening your workout and giving yourself more active recovery instead of going too hard and risking an injury.
Foam rolling
,
mobility work and stretching
, and massage (including from a massage gun), are all important elements that can help with rest and recovery, Rothstein says.
While you’re at it, don’t neglect other areas of wellness—they all can contribute to your overall results. “Nutrition,
hydration
, and sleep are primary,” Malin says. “People ought to really make sure they hit their caloric needs as well as carbohydrate and
protein goals
.” (It's generally
recommended
that regular exercisers eat 1.2 to 1.5 grams per kilogram of body weight to support tissue growth. So, for a 150-pound woman, that's about 82 to 102 grams of protein per day.)
Staying well hydrated (i.e., your pee is a pale yellow color) is important for good blood flow as well as to flush out waste, Malin says. And he recommends aiming for seven to nine hours of sleep a night, if you can.
“The key, again, is to almost have the mind frame that recovery is actually a part of your training,” Malin says. “Better athletes acknowledge that stress
and
recovery enables growth.”

When it comes to a quick burn you can do anywhere, resistance band workouts are in a league of their own. Portable, versatile, and deceptively effective, resistance bands are small-but-mighty tools that can help you sculpt strong muscles from head to toe—no gym required.
What makes resistance bands so special? Unlike
dumbbells
or
kettlebells
,
resistance bands
use oppositional force to train your muscles, meaning the band will feel heavier the more you stretch it, says personal trainer Kristina Earnest, AFAA, NASM. “This challenges you to maintain the speed and power you use to execute a movement through its full range of motion,” Earnest says.
Meet the expert:
Kristina Earnest
, AFAA, NASM, is a New York-based personal trainer with more than a decade of training and teaching under her belt. She offers hundreds of on-demand classes at
Kristina Earnest on Demand
.
That also means adjusting is simple: Swap to a heavier band or change its position on your body, like moving it higher or lower on your body part, for a greater challenge, Earnest says.
Pro tip: Keep a set of three
bands
—light, medium, and heavy—on hand to match the resistance level to different muscle groups, Earnest says. (And yes, even celebs like
Halle Berry
and
Jessica Alba
swear by resistance band workouts.)
Ready to stretch your strength training routine? Try this quick, do-anywhere resistance band workout created by Earnest, or explore  30 of the best
resistance band exercises
you can do at home or the gym. Bonus: Take on the
30-day resistance band challenge
to maximize your results.
Do resistance bands work for building muscle?
Absolutely! Resistance bands can be a super effective way to
build muscle
. “The key to helping your muscles grow is tension, sufficient recovery, muscle adaptation, and
progressive load
,” Earnest says. Resistance bands check all those boxes, making them an effective option for
strength training
.
However, if you’re a *daily* user of resistance bands, know that there may come a time when your body adapts to the challenge—even with the heaviest bands, says Earnest. When that happens, you can level up and continue getting stronger by incorporating weights into your routine. For example, you can do moves like
deadlifts
,
squats
, and
glute bridges
with both a resistance band and a dumbbell to give your workout that extra oomf of tension—resulting in more potential for muscle building.
Benefits Of Resistance Band Workouts:
Portable and travel-friendly
Builds strength and muscle
Offers adjustable resistance and progression options
Supports full range of motion
Low-impact, joint-friendly option
Great for targeting and isolating hard-to-reach muscles

There you are in the gym with your headphones in, listening to your perfectly curated playlist as you tackle steps on the
treadmill
and reps at the weight rack. You’re on your way to achieving your annual fitness goals (atta girl!), but you may be curious if you're experiencing weight loss
and
muscle gain at the same time—otherwise referred to as body recomposition. Let's get into it.
Body recomposition is “probably the thing I work on most with clients," says Phil Catudal, a NASM-certified personal trainer. At baseline, your muscles are important to help you do everyday normal activities and keeping them strong and in good working order is never a bad thing. What's more, though is that "muscles also have a higher metabolic rate than fat," says Mir Ali, MD, medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, California. “The more muscle you have, the more calories you burn at a resting state.” So, body recomposition is a huge help when it comes to weight management.
Benefits Of Body Recomposition
Improved cardiovascular health
Decreased risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events
Improved blood pressure, lipids, and blood sugar control
Improved mood
Decreased musculoskeletal ailments such as arthritis and falls
Meaning, that adding more muscle to the mix can help you to burn more calories—and ultimately lose more fat—when you're not exercising than you did before you built up your muscle strength. Now, for how to make body recomposition happen..
4 Important Tweaks To Lose Fat And Gain Muscle Simultaneously
1. Eat more protein than you think you need.
Protein
is the G.O.A.T. when it comes to build muscle and lose fat because two of its main roles in the body are repairing and building muscle. So, it should be a component of every single meal, Catudal says.
In fact, around 30 percent or more of your calories should come from protein, Catudal goes on. “If you're not getting enough protein while doing heavy weight training, you will not recover from your workouts enough to perform well, which means that you will not put on as much muscle or burn as much fat," he explains.
Let's take a 1,800-calorie diet for example. If you want to consume 30 percent of that in protein, you'll multiply that number by 0.30 to get 540 calories and then divide it by four (4 calories equals 1 gram of protein), which will put you at 135 grams. Most people aiming for 30 percent of their calories from protein will have a protein intake of 100 to 150 grams a day, Catudal says.
Meet the experts:
Phil Catudal
is a NASM-certified personal trainer and nutrition expert.
Erin Oprea
is a celebrity trainer and founder of the
Pretty Muscles workout app

Dina Khader
, RD, CDN, is a registered dietitian and integrative nutrition consultant.

, MD, is the medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, California.
Fatima Cody Stanford
, MD, MPH, MPA, is an associate professor of medicine and pediatrics at Harvard Medical School and an obesity medicine physician at Massachusetts General Hospital.
While there are plenty of proteins to choose from, Dina Khader, RD, CDN, prefers plant-based proteins (think: pea or sprouted rice protein powder). But if you're a meat and fish kind of person, Khader recommends lean meats like chicken and turkey. Other great protein sources from the experts include wild fish and beans. If you're a fan of red meat like beef, have it occasionally (once or twice a week), considering the fat consistency.
Celebrity trainer Erin Oprea also loves to add in some
eggs
and for clients worried about boredom, she recommends focusing on seasonings. Her literal secret sauce?
Coconut aminos
. “It has a similar taste to teriyaki sauce.”

2. Stay on top of your sleep schedule.
"If people are poor sleepers they will not burn fat as efficiently, and it's much harder to build muscle," says Khader. The nutritionist also pointed out that people who don't get enough sleep are always hungry, which means they are at risk for consuming above and beyond the amount of calories they really need.
3. Stay hydrated.
Your emotional support
water bottle
is a vital sidekick to keep handy throughout the day as
hydration is also super important
in body recomposition and in everyday life.
“Being hydrated and sleeping are so critical to basic human function. If you do all these things and you're not drinking water or you're sleeping four hours a night, it's either not going to work at all or work so much slower than if your body is in a good state,” Catudal says.
4. Consider tracking your calories.
Remember, calories give your body the energy it needs to function, but can also be stored as fat. To keep that from happening, you have two options: Reduce your calorie intake or increase your physical activity.
If you're looking to lose weight (rather than stay at the same weight but increase muscle while decreasing fat), consider creating a calorie deficit. You'll first want to determine the
baseline number of calories
per day your body needs. If you want a more specific analysis, Khader recommends having a dietitian perform a bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), a highly accurate test for body fat and muscle mass done through electrodes to determine how many calories your body needs. "You don't want go below 1,200 calories a day, because then you also start to break down muscle," says Khader.
You can also try
calorie cycling
(sometimes referred to as metabolic confusion), which involves changing up how many calories you aim to eat every day. There are a number of ways to implement the strategy—you may opt for a high-calorie day followed by a low-calorie day, or have an entire week of high-calorie days before having another week of low-calorie days (or somewhere in between). The thinking is that, by changing up your
caloric intake
, you confuse your body (and metabolism), encouraging it to burn more energy than if you just stayed at the same calorie intake each day.

Everything To Know About Calorie Cycling
In order to lose weight, “the whole idea is to be in a calorie deficit overall,” Dr. Ali notes. “You can do that intermittently, but different schedules and techniques work differently for different people.” For some, it’s better to be in a calorie deficit every day; For others, calorie cycling feels more approachable, he says.
If you don't want to focus too heavily on calories, that's definitely an option too, according to Oprea. "I never want my clients to be obsessing over their calorie intake," she says. “I personally don’t count calories and numbers, but I focus on correct serving size and to make sure every time you eat, you get a
complex carb
and a protein."
The Best Workouts For Fat Loss And Muscle Building
Weightlifting
and
HIIT training
are key for muscle gains and shedding fat. It may sound daunting to get into lifting, but “don’t be scared of weight training,” Oprea says. It's actually a major part in accomplishing fat loss and muscle gains at the same time because “weights help you to put on more muscle mass and burn more calories” and fat more efficiently says Khader.
There are a few different workout schedules that the experts recommend for body recomposition. Catudal recommends three to four days a week of 45-minute strength and weight-training workouts with 60-second rest periods in between exercises.
Oprea's go-to is a
Tabata workout
where each round lasts four minutes. You'll do 20 seconds of all-out intensity, followed by 10 seconds of rest, repeated eight times.
Aerobic exercise
can be helpful, too, Dr. Ali adds: “It’s a good idea to have a combination of aerobic and resistance-type exercises—aerobic can help you burn calories and is good for cardiovascular health, while resistance training helps to build muscle.” Whether you enjoy going for 30-minute walks with your dog, swimming laps at the gym, or hopping on your Peloton for a ride, these aerobic exercises are all worthwhile for your muscle-gaining journey.
How To Measure Fat Loss And Muscle Gain
Fatima Cody Stanford
, MD, MPH, MPA, an associate professor of medicine and pediatrics at Harvard Medical School and an obesity medicine physician at Massachusetts General Hospital, suggests getting a simple tape measure and checking your waist circumference. (The CDC has
detailed information
on exactly where to measure yourself.)
A waist circumference of greater than 35 inches could mean that you have a higher risk of developing obesity-related conditions, the
CDC
says.
There are body composition scales that can break this down for you, but Dr. Ali points out that it can be tough to know how reliable they are. Similarly, a formal body composition test, such as a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) can help, says Bryant Walrod, MD, a sports medicine physician at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center and head team physician for The Ohio State Buckeyes football team. Just know that these tests can be expensive.
Luckily, you may be able to find a body composition test at a gym near you. Various Planet Fitness, YMCA, Edge Fitness, etc. locations offer InBody scan, a non-invasive test that assesses body muscle, fat, and water. Your gym may offer this for free or at a discounted rate. Plus, you can find an InBody scan location near you with their
handy map feature
.
Overall, you may want some personalized guidance to help get your muscle gain journey started and see you through. Your primary care doctor can make sure you’re healthy enough to go on a new exercise and diet plan, while a fitness trainer can help you find specific exercises that feel right for you, Dr. Ali says. (Most local gyms will offer an introductory session for free to get you started.) A nutritionist can also help you to come up with an eating plan that meets your nutritional needs while feeling doable for you, he says.

Does Pilates Help You Build Muscle? Instructors Reveal The Truth
Does Pilates Help You Build Muscle? Instructors Reveal The Truth
Plus, how to incorporate Pilates into a hypertrophy training plan.
By
Amy Wilkinson

As the popularity of Pilates—and those oh-so-Instagram-able reformer classes—has increased over the past few years, so too has the hype surrounding the method’s benefits. (
Build
long and lean lines! Lift your booty! Snatch your obliques!
) Some social media-savvy instructors would have you believe you’ll be leaving with six-pack abs practically overnight. And as
strong
has largely replaced
skinny
as the goal of exercising (thank goodness, amiright?), who wouldn’t want to walk out of class with bangin’ bis and tris as evidence of all that hard work?
But how true are some of these claims related to building visible muscle and growing certain body parts? Can Pilates
really
help you build strength in a significant way? Or should we focus more on its other body benefits? Here’s everything you need to know about Pilates’ role in muscle hypertrophy.
Meet the experts:
Rachel Miller
, PT, DPT, is a physical therapist, certified Pilates instructor, and founder of the Pilates PT.
Shannon Ritchey
, PT, DPT, is a physical therapist, fitness trainer, and host of
The Dr. Shannon Show
podcast.
The type of Pilates you do will influence whether it can help with muscle growth.
It’s difficult to make broad, sweeping generalizations about what Pilates can and can’t do for your body. The method was devised a century ago by Joseph Pilates, but the term “Pilates” itself
is not trademarked
, so really any fitness instructor can claim they teach the modality, even if they haven’t gone through a specialized training program.
Within the Pilates industry there are classical studios that hew closely to the original teachings and techniques of Joseph Pilates, then there are contemporary studios that have updated and modernized many of the exercises, and may be higher intensity, or incorporate other aerobic exercise or strength training elements. Any of these modernizations would affect whether a particular class is impactful for muscle growth.

Your Complete Guide To Mat Pilates
Pilates can also use a host of apparatuses: You can do Pilates
on a mat
, on a
reformer
, on a tower, or on a chair. And they all work your body in slightly different ways.
Mat, for instance, uses gravity and your own body weight as resistance, while the reformer uses spring resistance to intensify some exercises and assist with others. (Unlike in strength training, adding resistance doesn’t automatically make an exercise harder in Pilates.) And let’s not forget all the studio off-shoots that use “Pilates-inspired” equipment to move you through muscle-quivering choreography. So, yeah, there’s a lot to consider when you talk about Pilates.
Here’s what classical Pilates does to your muscles.
For our purposes, we’ll approach the Pilates method with the same mindset as its founder—one rooted in precision and control, with exercises that can be done on a mat or on a piece of equipment. “In Pilates, exercises are usually performed slowly and with a smaller number of repetitions to focus on quality over quantity,” explains Rachel Miller, PT, DPT, a physical therapist and certified Pilates instructor.
Because Pilates exercises are done in a slow, low-repetition manner, they typically work what are known as type 1, or slow-twitch, muscles, says Shannon Ritchey, a physical therapist and fitness trainer.
“Those types of methods generally target the smaller muscle fibers that are responsible for muscular endurance,” Ritchey says. “Muscle endurance, in Pilates specifically, is your ability to hold positions for longer. Basically, you're improving your body's stamina.”
There could be instances, however, in which you work the type 2 or fast-twitch muscles in a Pilates class. Say you’re performing the classic ab series exercise known as criss-cross (essentially bicycle crunches) and your instructor tells you to double your pace. That short, quick burst of effort may be enough to target those fast-twitch fibers. Miller adds that by incorporating a prop like a jumpboard (a platform that allows you to jump while lying down on the carriage) into your reformer work , you could also potentially target type 2 muscles. Generally speaking, however, those instances will be few and far between.
Now for the truth about whether Pilates can lead to muscle
growth...
Now, it’s important to clarify that building muscle endurance is not the same as building muscle (a.k.a.,
hypertrophy
). For hypertrophy to occur, several criteria must be met.
To start, to train for hypertrophy, traditionally the muscles have to be worked to failure in 30 reps or less. “If you’re not approaching muscular failure—even though the exercise feels hard and burns and you may shake and tremble—science shows that you generally won't see much muscle growth because the load is too light,” Ritchey says. “Typically because you're not using enough load, you won't see much muscle growth from Pilates.”
That said, if you are going from a sedentary lifestyle to one incorporating daily movement and exercise, you may notice small gains from Pilates in the beginning.
For instance, when researchers put nine, non-active women on a regimen of Pilates twice a week for nine months, they observed hypertrophy in the muscles of the abdominal wall (especially the rectus abdominis), according to a study published in the journal
Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise
. A similar (albeit uncontrolled) clinical trial in
The Journal of Bodywork and Movement Therapies
also noted an increase in abdominal wall thickness among previously sedentary women who began doing Pilates. (But when the researchers from the first study took the same approach in measuring potential hypertrophy of the quads and glutes, they found a “small, nonsignificant difference” in the before and after, according to the separate study published in
Sports Health
.)
“Generally, when you go from something to nothing, you're going to see what's called ‘newbie gains,’” Ritchey explains. But, eventually, you’ll hit a plateau and need to increase the effort to continue to see results. And that’s where it gets tricky with Pilates because not only does more spring tension often make an exercise
easier
, but even for the exercises in which spring tension increases the effort, the load is finite.
“If your goal is to enter a bodybuilding competition or bench press 200 pounds, Pilates is not going to get you there all by itself.”
“Pilates is almost the opposite of strength-training principles because lighter is often harder for people,” Miller says. “For any muscle hypertrophy, we have to challenge it…But there is a limit. We only have so many springs.”
Miller's bottom line: “If your goal is to enter a bodybuilding competition or bench press 200 pounds, Pilates is not going to get you there all by itself.”
Pilates has tons of benefits *beyond* changing your muscles.
While Pilates alone isn’t going to make you swole, there are still plenty of benefits to reserving your spot in that Saturday morning reformer class.
“I love the concept of strengthening and dynamically stretching at the same time, which is incorporated into quite a few Pilates exercises on the equipment,” Miller says. “I feel like there's also a focus on creating balance in the body.”
Ritchey agrees: “One of the really good benefits of Pilates is neuromuscular control and improving your body awareness, especially if you go to a good teacher. The cues are very specific. The body positions are very specific. You're instructed on what you should be feeling, how you should be feeling it, how to breathe, how to move, how to connect to your body.”
There’s also a solid body of research that indicates Pilates may help with aches and pains. Pilates was found to help alleviate low-back pain better than other singularly focused exercise modalities (such as general strengthening and aerobics), according to a
2021 meta analysis
. (Ritchey cautions that not all back ailments are the same, so what may relieve pain for one person may cause it for another—so proceed with caution, and when in doubt, check with your doc!)
You can certainly incorporate Pilates into a hypertrophy routine—here's how.
If your primary focus is hypertrophy but you love the way Pilates makes you feel, you certainly shouldn’t (and don’t have to!) give it up. You’ll just need to be smart about how and when you incorporate it into your routine, says Ritchey.
“I generally recommend, if your goal is to build muscle, having a hypertrophy routine as your cornerstone, and then building in everything else with the time that you have left,” she says.
Ritchey suggests working each muscle group of the body two-ish times per week, aiming for four to five sets over the course of that week. After that, get in at least 150 minutes of light to moderate intensity cardio, such as walking or biking. She also recommends incorporating a tiny bit of
high-intensity interval training (HIIT)
—the equivalent of a 10- to 15-minute class per week. Then, with your free day, you can incorporate Pilates as an active recovery. Emphasis on
recovery
.

$9 at Amazon
I got these Amazon-find grip socks before my first barre class, and I’ve never looked back. They’re super affordable (much more-so than the ones you might have to buy last-minute at your studio) and keep me planted on the floor, even during a particularly sweaty session.
“If you're going to a class that's kind of annihilating you, it might not be enough or the right stimulus to build muscle, and yet it could still be interfering with your recovery and your results overall,” Ritchey says.
Adds Miller: “I think Pilates is a great adjunct because it's going to strengthen the deep core, it's going to help you with movement patterns, and it's going to help you decrease your risk of injury as well as enhance your performance in multiple sports.”
So while Pilates isn’t going to give you a head-to-toe muscle transformation in two months, there’s still plenty of reasons to continue embracing your Pilates Girlie Era.

While having toned biceps is certainly a flex—literally—that’s not the only muscle you should work on arm day. To build all-around upper-body strength (oh, and gain even more muscle definition in your arms), you need to spend a little time working all the
arm muscles
: namely, the triceps.
Yup, this minor muscle group on the back of the arms is the key to overall fitness. "The triceps are a super, super important muscle group," says
Jacquelin
e Kasen
, CPT, a Miami-based coach and master trainer and senior director of group fitness at Anatomy. "They stabilize your arms and your shoulders. They also help increase range of motion. So if you're strong there, the triceps also help support the chest, back, and shoulders."
If you want to sculpt all 360 degrees of your
upper arms
(or finally nail that
chaturanga
in your next yoga class), it's time to add a triceps workout into your routine and give this muscle group some much-deserved attention. These are the 12 most effective triceps exercises for strong, toned arms, according to trainers.
Meet the Expert:
Jacqueline Kasen
, CPT, is a Miami-based coach and master trainer and senior director of group fitness at Anatomy.
Why You Should Strengthen Your Triceps Muscles
Your triceps, which run along the backs of your upper arms, actually consist of three muscles—the long head, medial head, and lateral head—hence "tri." Together, these muscles help you extend your elbows and straighten your arms—and assist in chest-dominant exercises, like those infamous yogi pushups. There are different exercises that work different parts of your triceps, so it's important to incorporate a variety of triceps exercises into your workout routine in order to build well-rounded strength.
12 Best Triceps Exercises
Ready to feel the backs of those arms burn? The moves listed here make for a fast and effective tricep workout.
Time
: 15 minutes
| Equipment
: mat, dumbbells |
Good for:
triceps
Instructions
: Choose one triceps exercise from each group below (A, B, and C). Complete three sets of the indicated number of reps for each move. Once you've completed all sets of one move, continue to the next, in ABC order, resting as needed. Add these triceps moves into your
upper-body workout routine
three days per week for toned arms.
A: Dumbbell floor press, alternating dumbbell floor press
B: Pushup, triceps pushup, sphinx press, dolphin pushup
C: Lying overhead triceps extension, triceps kickback, triceps dip, overhead triceps extension, triceps circle, plank triceps kickback
Remember to focus on your form and posture.
One of the most common mistakes Kasen sees with triceps exercises is rounded posture. To fix it, pull your shoulders back and down and check that they stay there through all the reps. That ensures you're targeting the triceps from start to finish.
1
Dumbbell Floor Press
Why it rocks:
Your super stable position in this move allows you to challenge your triceps with heavier weights than in many others while engaging nearby muscle groups.
How to:
Lie faceup with knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Hold a dumbbell in each hand with elbows out about 45 degrees from sides.
Keep lower back pressed into floor, press weights straight up over chest, and extend arms.
Pause for a moment at the top.
Slowly bend elbows to lower weights back down until backs of upper arms return to floor.
That's 1 rep.
Complete 8 to 10 reps.

2
Alternating Dumbbell Floor Press
Why it rocks:
Alternating floor presses give your arms a little more rest than pressing both sides together so you can push extra weight. They also hit your core a little harder.
How to:
Lie faceup with knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Hold a dumbbell in each hand with elbows out about 45 degrees from sides.
Keep lower back pressed into floor, press weight in left hand straight up over chest, and extend arm.
Bend left elbow to lower weight down until back of upper left arm returns to floor.
That's 1 rep.
Complete 8 to 10 reps, then repeat with right arm.

3
Modified Pushup
Why it rocks:
The pushup is an all-around power move, working your chest, back, core, glutes, triceps, and biceps at once. Maintain your form and it's a fast-track to stronger tris.
How to:
Start in a high plank position with shoulders over wrists. (Option to modify and rest knees on floor, if needed.)
Keep
core
tight, bend elbows, and lower body until arms form 90-degree angles. (Elbows should point 45 degrees away from sides.)
Press back to start position.
That’s 1 rep.
Complete 8 to 10 reps.
4
Eccentric Triceps Pushup
Why it rocks:
Compared to the standard pushup, the close-grip pushup places greater emphasis on your triceps, hitting all three heads
hard.
How to:
Start in a high plank position, but with hands directly beneath chest instead of shoulders and holding dumbbells. (Option to rest knees on floor as a modification.)
Bend elbows straight back towards feet to lower body until lightly touching the floor, keeping upper arms close to sides.
Shift hips back and reset in plank position.
That's 1 rep.
Complete 8 to 10 reps.
Advertisement - Continue Reading Below
5
Sphinx Pushup
Why it rocks:
No equipment required for this advanced pushup variation. It gives your triceps a hard-burning, laser-like focus and simultaneously works the core.
How to:
Start in a forearm plank position on toes with head to heels aligned. (Option to modify and start on knees.)
Keeping hips level, lift forearms off the floor and extend arms, balancing weight on hands and toes.
Slowly and with control, lower forearms to tap the floor.
Then, push back up to starting position.
That's 1 rep.
Complete 8 to 10 reps.
6
Dolphin Pushup
Why it rocks:
Love ‘em or hate ‘em, pushups activate the muscles
hard
. This slightly inverted variation works the triceps harder than a traditional pushup.
How to:
Start in an upside down "V" shape, palms pushing into floor and heels high.
Bend at elbows and lower forearms down to floor at same time.
Reverse motion and extend arms to return to start.
That's 1 rep.
Complete 10 reps.
Advertisement - Continue Reading Below
7
Lying Overhead Triceps Extension
Why it rocks:
Also known as skull crushers, lying extensions target the long head of your triceps and take stress off your back so you can focus on your arms.
How to:
Lie faceup with legs bent and feet flat on the floor holding a pair of dumbbells so arms are extended toward ceiling in line with shoulders.
Without moving upper arms, slowly bend at elbows to lower weights to frame face.
Pause, then slowly press weights back up overhead.
That's 1 rep.
Complete 8 to 10 reps.
8
Dumbbell Triceps Kickback
Why it rocks:
Bilateral (a.k.a. both-sided) kickbacks are
challenging
and activate your core while targeting the medial and laterals heads of your triceps.
How to:
Stand with knees slightly bent and body hinged forward at 45 degrees holding a dumbbell in each hand, elbows bent and close to body.
Keep upper arms still, then press dumbbells back to straighten arms, squeezing triceps.
Reverse movement to return to start with control.
That's 1 rep.
Complete 8 to 10 reps.
9
Triceps Dip
Why it rocks:
All you need is your bodyweight to feel the burn in the lateral and medial heads of your triceps pretty much immediately.
How to:
Sit on the edge of a chair (or similar elevated surface) with spine straight and upright and feet flat on the floor, slightly wider than hip-width apart.
Grip the front edge of the chair. Scoot forward until you are off of the chair and only supported only by arms.
Keeping back flat and core engaged, slowly bend elbows to lower body as low as you can.
Reverse movement to return to start.
That's 1 rep.
Complete 8 to 10 reps.
10
Overhead Triceps Extension
Why it rocks:
This one hits the long head of your triceps hard
and
works your core. Just keep that spine straight and ribs from flaring forward.
How to:
Stand holding one dumbbell between both hands overhead with straight arms. (Option to hold two weights together overhead.)
Keep biceps by ears, then bend elbows to lower dumbbell slowly behind head.
Pause, then press weight back up to straighten arms, returning to start.
That's 1 rep.
Complete 8 to 10 reps.
Advertisement - Continue Reading Below
11
Plank Triceps Kickback
Why it rocks:
Planks provide a burn for a plethora of muscles, from your abdominals to your shoulders to your (you guessed it) triceps. Throw in a traditional triceps kickback to push that activation to the max.
How to:
Start in a high-plank position with feet slightly wider than shoulders.
Hold a dumbbell in right hand, elbow bent until tricep is in line with torso.
Extend arm back, until it’s completely straight.
Reverse movement to return to start.
That’s 1 rep.
Complete 5 reps on each side.
12
Triceps Circle
Why it rocks:
Just when you thought you've seen them all, enter triceps circles. This mobility and strength challenge will torch triceps and stretch shoulders through a full range of motion using only your bodyweight.
How to:
Start on all fours with knees under hips, hands under shoulders, and spine neutral. (Level up by starting in a high plank position.)
Bend elbows to lower forearms and chest to almost touch the floor.
Skim the floor with torso to bring nose past hands.
Push into the floor with hands to extend arms to return to start.
T
hat's 1 rep.
Complete 8 to 10 reps.

Hear me out: No pizza is complete without pineapple, and no upper-body day is complete without hitting your back muscles. After all, a well-rounded workout routine includes hitting *every* major muscle group, even the ones you that may fall on the
back
burner, like, well your back.
Here's why: Your back muscles, which include the lats and traps, have important jobs to perform. Collectively, they help you lift heavy loads (think: groceries, kids, and weights) and they're responsible for
posture
and holding you up. Strengthening your back will help you build
muscular endurance
, help sculpt your bod, and improve your posture, especially if you sit a lot during the day, says Colleen Conlon, CPT, a certified personal trainer with experience as an instructor at Equinox, a Studio Manager at Crunch, and a fitness producer at DailyBurn. “If you’re going to be stationary, you need to strengthen your back so you’re not rounded,” says Conlon.
Meet the experts:
Vanessa Abrams
is a certified athletic trainer and human anatomy lecturer at Howard University.

But that’s not all when it comes to strong-back benefits. Targeting your spine-supporting muscles “can help decrease pain associated with large breasts, repetitive lifting, or prolonged periods spent sitting or even with shoulders retracted while accomplishing a DIY protective hairstyle, like braids,” says certified athletic trainer Vanessa Abrams, a human anatomy lecturer at Howard University.
However, back muscles tend to fatigue quicker than others. So, “while maxing out may be difficult, high reps and sets are
especially
beneficial,” Abrams says. (Noted!)

How To Decide Between Extra Sleep Or That Early Morning Workout, According To Trainers
How To Decide Between Extra Sleep Or That Early Morning Workout, According To Trainers
There are benefits to both, depending on your situation.

It’s January, and toward the top of your list of resolutions might be something along the lines of:
Sleep more
and
workout more. Hey, both are pretty dang important. But let’s say you got a rough night of sleep last night and are now faced with a dilemma: to get out of bed and go workout … or to silence your alarm and enjoy an extra hour of sleep?
At the end of the day, the decision is highly personal—it comes down to your own health goals, schedule, and priorities. But research indicates that exercise can actually help curb some of the negative physiological effects of a bad night’s sleep. Interestingly, as Rhonda Patrick, PhD, a biomedical scientist and researcher focused on the intersection of sleep, exercise, and metabolic health, shared on
Instagram
, a single four-hour night of sleep can lead to negative short-term physiological effects in healthy people—but
high-intensity interval training
(HIIT) may help counteract some of those effects.
But while trading an hour of sleep for an hour of exercise can sometimes have a positive effect, sacrificing rest to
maintain your strength
and physique is not a sustainable long-term solution. So, how do you navigate this tricky balancing act?
Ahead, doctors and fitness experts break down the science of how exercise can offset the effects of short-term sleep deprivation, how to identify when it makes sense to prioritize movement over snoozing, and share practical tips for prioritizing both rest and fitness.
Meet the experts:
Alexander Rothstein
, CSCS, ACSM-EP, is an exercise physiologist and instructor for the exercise science program at New York Institute of Technology.
Navya Mysore
, MD, is a physician, medical director of the
Nurx
app, and
Women’s Health
medical advisory board member.
To snooze or to sweat? Here’s what the science says.
There are tons of
recovery tools
out there to help your muscles recoup after a tough workout, but sleep trumps them all. Acting as your body’s ultimate recovery tool, sleep is when the bulk of essential physiological processes occur, including muscle repair,
hormone regulation
, neurological repair—you name it—keeping your energy and mood in check, says Alexander Rothstein, EdD, CSCS, an exercise physiologist, strength coach, and educator.
During
deep sleep
, growth hormone production peaks,
repairing muscle tissue
damaged during exercise. At the same time, stress hormones like
cortisol
are balanced, and blood sugar levels are regulated. Skipping even one night of quality rest can disrupt these processes, potentially leading to fatigue and impaired recovery.

Everything You Need To Know About Barre Classes
Chronic sleep deprivation can have an even bigger impact. A 2023 systematic review in
Cureus
linked poor sleep to increased cortisol levels, which can trigger
insulin resistance
and raise
blood sugar
—a precursor to
type 2 diabetes
. “We see a pattern where individuals demonstrate compromised physiological function without adequate sleep and recovery,” says Rothstein, underscoring that sleep is essential for maintaining the health of all bodily systems.
But exercise can help offset some of the negative effects of insufficient sleep. HIIT improved
cardiovascular function
even after a night of partial sleep deprivation, a 2020 study in the
European Journal of Applied Physiology
found. In the study, 15 healthy men alternated between well-rested and sleep-deprived conditions with or without exercise. The results showed that exercise boosted
cardiovascular health
regardless of sleep quality, suggesting that getting active after a rough night can still benefit your heart.
Exercise also supports your
brain
and
mood
when sleep falls short. A 2023 study in
Health Nexus
explored how low-intensity aerobic exercise, like a
brisk walk or light jog
, impacted 21 female volleyball players after partial sleep deprivation. While their reaction times and motor responses were slower after a bad night of sleep, the exercise improved focus and mood.
So, the occasional trade-off of an hour of sleep for a workout might be okay. But doing so all the time isn’t sustainable. Chronic sleep deprivation paired with regular physical activity can lead to
fatigue
, stress, and mood swings—undermining the benefits of both sleep and exercise. So, while exercise can help soften the blow of a bad night’s sleep, consistent, high-quality rest is non-negotiable for long-term overall health.
When It’s Okay To Trade Sleep For A Workout
“The body is incredibly adaptive and resilient, but it has limits,” Rothstein says. “Sacrificing sleep in order to make time for exercise is a plausible solution that can help improve health and fitness, but it needs to be carefully balanced with managing proper sleep and recovery within one’s lifestyle.” He suggests pushing through the workout after a night of poor sleep sparingly—perhaps once per week—while prioritizing sleep on other days to allow your body to fully recover.

“Finding the best time to work out can be like a Tetris game of when you can actually fit it in,” says Navya Mysore, MD, physician and
Women’s Health
medical advisory board member. Try fitting in a HIIT workout on a day you feel a little tired, and see if it helps you feel more energized. Listening to your body is key to determining what works best for you.
When Sleep Should Come First
More times than not, sleep should trump all. “I always come back to trying to have a solid night of sleep,” says Dr. Mysore, who recommends seven to nine hours per night, though she acknowledges this can be challenging. Consistent
lack of sleep
not only disrupts
cognitive function
, but also impairs physical performance and can even contribute to
hypertension
,
obesity
, increased risk of
diabetes
,
anxiety and depression
.
So, how do you know when to hit the hay instead of the gym? “Whenever you are feeling physically and/or mentally run down,” says Rothstein. This includes signs of
burnout
, illness, or overtraining. He recommends adding extra rest whenever possible to help prevent setbacks. Listening to your body and prioritizing recovery will ultimately support your fitness goals.

How To Nail The Balancing Act
Life is complicated and we’re all only human. Despite our best efforts, getting seven to nine hours of sleep
and
squeezing in a workout a few times per week can be a challenge. It might not always be feasible, but here are some expert tips to help:
Sacrifice sleep to exercise on occasion, not daily
. This allows the body to get both an increased amount of sleep on non-exercise days and gets more exercise stimulus on exercise days.
Listen to your body
. “At times you begin to feel more burnt out, you can consider getting more sleep instead of exercise,” Rothstein says. When you’re feeling healthy and up to moving your body even if you’re groggy after a bad night, “you can integrate exercise.”
Plan ahead
. On a Sunday, try to block off time in your week for when you can squeeze in a workout. “Try to find the space for it when it makes sense so it’s convenient,” Dr. Mysore says. Whether it’s right after dropping off your kids or during your lunch break, this gives you the best chance of making it work.
See how it feels
. “Try not to have an all or nothing mindset,” Dr. Mysore says. She recommends trying a workout once or twice after a short night of sleep and then assessing how you feel afterward. Did it energize you? Drain you more? If it feels more helpful than harmful, it might be a viable tool for you as needed.
Be flexible
. “Give yourself permission to adapt your plans as needed,” she says. If you wake up to your alarm and your body is just not feeling good, that extra hour of sleep might be better for you than moving your body. It’s ok to adjust the plan according to how you feel.
Think: teamwork
. Whether it’s a partner or another support system, communicate that making time for your workout is important and work as a team to make sure you get your sweat session in while all other responsibilities are taken care of.

The Zwift Ride Changed My At-Home Workouts. Here Are My Takeaways.
The Zwift Ride Changed My At-Home Workouts. Here Are My Takeaways.
This indoor-cycle setup was easy to install and offered me a challenging workout without any need to leave my home.

Zwift
I’m passionate about many things: my family, my dog, my morning cup of cold brew, my triathlons, and my road bike. I’m less than enthused, however, about cycling in dreary weather conditions, which in the New York City winter months can mean wet roads, stinging sleet, and heavy snow. Sure, there are alternatives: group cycling classes, signing up for warm-weather destination races, braving the negative windchill—but all I really want is an at-home cycling setup that’s easy to install and fun to ride.
So when I was offered an opportunity to try out the Zwift Ride—an indoor-cycling trainer that pairs with the Zwift virtual-cycling app via Bluetooth—I jumped at the opportunity. Zwift gets big props from cyclists of all stripes for how closely the technology mimics IRL rides, so I was eager to get on board and give it a spin. Here’s what I learned after a couple of weeks in the stationary saddle.
Lesson 1: It’s Way Easier to Bring Home Than I Thought
Generally speaking, I’m
terrible
at setting things up. It once took me over a week to figure out how to put together a dining room chair … that only had two parts! So I admit I was a bit apprehensive when the
Zwift Ride
landed on my doorstep. But the
instructional setup videos
were so easy to follow that I had my riding station assembled on my
training mat
in just a few minutes. All that was left to do was download the Zwift app on my phone, and then pair it with the smart trainer via Bluetooth.
Zwift
With my phone secure in the
handlebar tablet holder
, I was off to the races. This first takeaway ended up being as important as any: Zwift Ride was
so
much easier to set up, install, and get riding on than I anticipated. And at a $1,300 price point, it’s more affordable than many other smart bikes. Same goes for the Zwift app, which has a $200 annual membership plan. The Zwift Ride and annual plan together comes out to just about $5 per day—not much more than a cup of coffee! For those prioritizing flexibility, there’s also a monthly plan that’s $20 per month.

Lesson 2: The Real World and Virtual World Work Together
I quickly found myself exploring Watopia, one of the most popular virtual courses in the Zwift app. These are animated maps that you ride around as a 3D avatar alongside other cyclists from around the (real) world. It’s such an immersive experience—and Zwift is also compatible with smart TVs, tablets, and laptops, which have larger screens that add to the feeling of really
being there
. As I cruised around, my Zwift Ride would emulate whatever terrain I was seeing on my screen. For example, when the virtual roads were steep, my real-world trainer provided more resistance, so it felt like I was really climbing uphill. This kept me engaged with my ride, ensuring I was always physically challenged in a productive way.
Lesson 3: It’s Great for Multifaceted Training
As a triathlete, I aim for a blend of training methods. Zwift has workouts that helped my endurance training, including high-intensity intervals, power and endurance rides, and VO2-max builders. It also has plenty of cycling-specific workouts, such as sprints, climbs, and recovery rides. And you don’t need to do these alone: Many of the Zwift workouts are written by professional cyclists who give encouragement and tips along the way. With over 2,000 available workouts, I could always find a way to fit Zwift into my day. For example, on particularly busy days, I signed up for short interval rides. Whenever I had more time, I’d do longer endurance-focused rides.
Zwift
Lesson 4: I’m Kinda Competitive? (Maybe I Already Knew That…)
I don’t like to fall behind when I ride in the park with my cycling buddies in NYC, but I tend to give riders who pass me a nod and stick to my own pace when I’m riding solo. However, seeing my avatar get passed in Watopia awakened my competitive side! When the app urged me to “close the gap,” I couldn’t help but push myself to make up the distance—or at least do my best to not fall farther behind. And yet the app always felt in tune with my honest ability—these messages were motivational without encouraging me to exert myself
too
hard.
Lesson 5: There’s a World of Community
As I rode around Watopia, I encountered cyclists with so many different national flags above their avatars. This made me realize how big the Zwift community is. And it’s not like everyone’s just on their own siloed rides—it’s a truly social experience if you want it to be. The Zwift companion app makes it easy to connect with friends, join group rides, join clubs, and find friends on Zwift. And to make races fair and competitive, their new Racing Score system calculates your performance to match you with other cyclists who you’ll keep pace with. Knowing that I could always join a group ride, no matter how isolating the weather outside of my home might feel, was comforting.
Final Takeaways
I was always so glad to have Zwift as an option when the weather outside was bleak, or I just wasn’t up for an outdoors ride at the end of a long workday. With 12 different virtual worlds, 120 different routes, and over 2,000 workouts—plus additional training plans, racing, fitness tracking, and group ride options
—
there was always something new to keep me engaged. The best part, though, was that I never felt like I was short-changing my training or phoning it in. The Zwift rides were just as challenging as real-world cycling, with one huge bonus: I never had to change a flat.

Why Trust Us?
Anbereen Hasan grew up swimming and dabbled in
Pilates
as an adult, but she wanted to start her weight loss journey after gaining weight in her early 50s. (“It happened to every woman in my family as they got older,” she says.) So, she discussed the option of going on
Mounjaro
, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, with her doctor in November of 2022.
Her doctor was on board, so long as Hasan also agreed to start
resistance training
—something she had only done briefly in the 90s with five-pound weights—in order to preserve her muscle mass. “My doctor was pretty clear that I would have to do weight training,” says Hasan.
The 55-year-old found
Tina Tang, CPT
, a certified personal trainer, strength coach, and founder of Iron Strong Fitness, in April of 2023, via Instagram. “I did a ton of research before I settled on [working with] Tina as a personal trainer,” Hasan says. She liked that Tang was following and referencing Hasan’s endocrinologist in her social media posts. “We did a phone consultation and clicked right away.”
Hasan's decision to invest in her muscle maintenance made total sense: While muscle loss is an issue for women to consider when losing weight by any means, the impact appears to be more drastic when a weight loss drug is involved, according to a 2024
article
in
The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology
. Specifically, studies suggest that muscle loss with GLP-1s can range from 25 to 39 percent of the total weight loss while muscle loss via caloric restriction (with less total weight loss) ranges from 10 to 30 percent.
Because strength training is one of the best ways to preserve and prevent muscle loss, it tracks that a slew of workout and wellness companies (including
Equinox
and the workout streaming platform
Obé
) are launching exercise programs specifically marketed toward people on these medications. What’s more, the American Council on Exercise (ACE) just launched
a new course
around supporting clients who are using anti-obesity medication for trainers and health coaches.

Perhaps in testament to her work with Tang—which involved kettlebells and barbells—Hasan’s initial muscle loss was minimal. Ultimately, she was able to
gain muscle and lose fat at the same time
—which she also attributes to switching from a high dose (15 milligrams) to a maintenance dose (7 milligrams) of the medication in addition to the lifestyle changes she made. (Hasan was able to keep tabs on her body composition changes with regular InBody scans each time she visited her prescribing doctor, as well as
DEXA scans
.)
Hasan emphasizes that going from maintenance to actual muscle
gaining
mode took time—and that it was all about patience and consistency. Today, she lifts weights five times a week (since she’s retired, “I have the time!” she says) and she can see and feel her muscle and strength gains.
Hasan is proof that you’re not destined to lose all your muscle and strength if you decide to go on a weight loss medication. You just have to be smart about your nutrition and training. We spoke with obesity medicine doctors, nutritionists, and trainers for all the intel and tips for maintaining—even gaining!—muscle while on a GLP-1.
Why GLP-1s Make Muscle Maintenance And Gain Tougher
In short, this is thanks to the fact that these drugs are very effective, according to the author of the
Lancet
article, Carla Prado, PhD, RD, Canada Research Chair in Integrative Nutrition, Body Composition, and Energy Metabolism at the University of Alberta. “[GLP-1s] lead to substantial weight loss which in turn leads to substantial losses of muscle mass,” which can be detrimental, says Prado.
Indeed, the sheer amount of weight loss is one factor that determines how much muscle loss you’re likely to experience on a GLP-1, agrees Ian J. Neeland, MD, director of cardiovascular prevention and co-director of the Center for Integrated and Novel Approaches in Vascular-Metabolic Disease for University Hospitals Harrington Heart & Vascular Institute, who has also authored studies on the subject. “People who lose more weight will be at risk for losing more muscle—it goes in a linear fashion,” Dr. Neeland explains. “Although data is sparse, since people lose so much more weight with GLP-1 medications compared with diet and exercise alone, the amount of muscle loss is more for [those on these] medications.”
Meet the experts:

Dina Peralta-Reich,
MD, is an obesity medicine specialist and founder of

.
Tina Tang
, CPT, is a certified personal trainer, strength coach, and founder of

.
Other factors that play a role in muscle loss (or maintenance) while on weight loss meds include whether you have certain health conditions (like heart disease and diabetes) as well as the type of medication you take. Some
clinical trials
show that, while tirzepatide (the active ingredient in Mounjaro and Zepbound) leads to larger weight loss, tirzepatide users also seem to experience less muscle loss
compared to those on semaglutide
(the active ingredient in Ozempic), Dr. Neeland says. More research is needed to figure out exactly why that is, though. Older and more sedentary people also may be more at risk for higher lean body mass loss, he adds.
Lifestyle factors within your control also play a massive role. For anyone who goes on a weight loss medication, “if they stay active, they exercise, they maintain good nutrition, that all can go a long way to preventing muscle loss and preserving muscle mass with weight loss,” Dr. Neeland says.
Why Preserving Your Gains Is So Critical
Setting aside the fact that building any degree of muscle is typically hard-earned, and therefore, hard to part with, “skeletal muscle is an important organ for overall health, going far beyond its role in physical movement and strength,” says Prado. It’s a “metabolic powerhouse,” she says, since muscle helps regulate blood sugar levels by taking up glucose, which is essential for preventing conditions like insulin resistance and diabetes.
“Substantial losses of muscle can also weaken our immune system, making individuals more prone to infections and reducing their ability to recover from illnesses and injuries,” she says. “Skeletal muscle acts as a storage of amino acids that our bodies rely on during times of stress, injury, and infection.” Muscle loss also often comes along with
bone loss
, which is particularly worrisome for women in menopause: “We want to maximize muscle to prevent osteoporosis and other complications of aging,” says
Dina Peralta-Reich, MD
, an obesity medicine specialist and founder of
New York Weight Wellness Medicine
.
What’s more, if you choose to eventually reduce your medication dose or go off entirely, having more muscle mass helps you maintain your weight loss. (More muscle mass means more calories burned at rest.)

How To Preserve—Even Gain—Muscle Mass On A Weight Loss Drug
“When weight loss drugs are used correctly with the right monitoring and nutritional guidance, you can achieve minimal muscle loss,” says Dr. Peralta-Reich, who adds that the majority of her patients are able to maintain good muscle mass. She attributes this in part to conservative dosing, but also to other factors, which we’ll delve into below.
In terms of whether it’s possible to put
on
a decent amount of muscle while on GLP-1s, Dr. Neeland says, “no one has the answer to that. I don't think they have bodybuilders on GLP just yet.” However, general
weight loss studies
have shown that you can indeed gain muscle when losing weight, says Prado. Dr. Peralta-Reich says the determining factor is whether you’re in the weight loss or maintenance phase: Many women on these drugs will start with a weight loss phase—during which the goal is to decrease fat mass and maintain muscle, per Dr. Peralta-Reich—then shift to a maintenance phase. “During weight maintenance, the goal is to
increase
muscle mass,” says Dr. Peralta-Reich. So, not only is it possible, it’s encouraged.
Dr. Neeland points out that the path to success in maintaining or gaining muscle while on a GLP-1 is going to look different for everyone. But there are a few universal truths:
Lift weights two to three times a week.
Combining resistance exercise with a calorie deficit helps preserve muscle mass and improves muscle strength during weight loss, according to a 2017
review
in
Advances in Nutrition.
For general health, Dr. Neeland typically suggests people dedicate one-third of their exercise time to resistance training and two-thirds to aerobic exercise. For those actively losing weight on GLP-1s, he recommends they do half resistance training and half aerobic exercise (which might look like two to three days of each, depending on your current ability level).
For those on GLP-1s who are new to strength training, like Hasan was, the focus should be on learning the basics and building a foundation, Tang says. In general, she says to do two to three full-body workouts a week and to use heavy weights for fewer reps.

Adjust your lifts based on effort, or RPE.
Now, those who have been lifting for a while might actually notice they can’t
progressively overload
, or even go as heavy or do as much as they could before starting a weight loss medication.  “Don’t be married to specific numbers in the gym—the priority [at this time] is weight loss and muscle preservation,” says Tang.
She suggests using
rate of perceived exertion (RPE)
as your metric while your weight changes. “Following a pounds-specific progressive lifting program wouldn't be as ideal  since one's weight and body composition is shifting, thus taking away that constant consistent variable by which to compare progress with,” says Tang. As an example: After losing significant weight, back squatting 150 pounds might feel like too much—and trying to do it anyway because it used to feel easy could set you up for injury. For RPE while lifting, Tang suggests going for an eight out of 10 for most lifts.
Once your goal weight is reached, you can go back to aiming for a specific goal, like trying to increase your one rep max for major lifts like squats and deadlifts. Tang says to start by testing your five-rep max for each lift to get a sense of your new current numbers, and build up from there.
Add HIIT training to help stimulate human growth hormone (HGH).
For the aerobic activity you do incorporate, make it higher intensity to help trigger HGH, Tang suggests. A very small
study
of five women showed that a single bout of HIIT can indeed trigger the body’s natural HGH. Why is HGH important, you ask? It helps regulate muscle function and stimulates protein growth in muscles and muscle tissue, according to an older
review
in the
Journal of Molecular Endocrinology
.
Less is more when it comes to HIIT, Tang says. That means you can
cap workouts at 20 minutes
as long as you work hard during work intervals and actually rest during the rest intervals.

Consume 30 percent of your calories from protein.
“Generally, protein supplementation has been shown to preserve muscle [and] increase muscle synthesis,” says Dr. Neeland. (Dr. Neeland has applied for a grant for a randomized trial to actually look specifically at the impact of GLP on muscle and mitigation strategies, like protein supplementation.) “Shifting from the usual diet, which is about 15 percent protein, to about 30 percent protein may have an impact,” he says.

Research backs this up: Young men who consumed more protein while losing weight and on an intense exercise regiment gained about 2.5 pounds of muscle, while the young men who consumed less protein did not add muscle, according to a 2016
study
in the
American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.
Prado suggests aiming for 20 to 30 grams of protein per meal (to maximize muscle protein synthesis, the
metabolic process
by which skeletal muscle proteins are formed) and including a variety of protein sources, like lean meats, fish, eggs, dairy, legumes, tofu, and high-quality protein supplements if needed.
Consider certain supplements.
Good nutrition also means getting the essential vitamins and minerals, says Prado. And while there’s no evidence that people on weight loss medications need more of any one nutrient in particular, considering they are potentially at a greater risk of losing muscle, they can take advantage of additional nutrients that can benefit muscle, such as vitamin D, omega-3 fatty acids, and hydroxymethylbutyrate (HMB). “There is no direct research on the use of these nutrients in this specific context, so this is general advice,” she reiterates.
However, studies have looked at how supplementation—including vitamin D, fish-oil derived omega 3s, and HMB—might help preserve or build muscle, in general, according to a 2017
review
in
Advances in Nutrition.
A meta-analysis showed that vitamin D had a small but significant effect on muscle strength, especially in older people who were deficient, but no effect on muscle mass. A separate study showed that fish-oil derived omega-3s may improve muscle mass, strength, and physical function in older adults with stable weight, and HMB improved both muscle mass and strength in healthy young and older adults. (Remember to always talk to your doc before starting a new supplement!)
Make sure you’re eating enough—full stop.
Tang notes that one major nuance for those on weight loss medications is that they may not have much of an appetite—and this can impact performance in the gym. “I've heard from other trainers that have clients on GLP-1s that sometimes the client will be really tired because they don't have the appetite to eat enough, and they're not eating enough,” she says.

Dr. Neeland says that it’s crucial for people on these medications not to skip meals. “If you don't have enough fuel in the tank, you won't be able to exercise or function very well,” he says. “People have to be mindful to continue adequate nutrition, even if they're [eating] less food,” he says, adding that they should focus on “high-yield” foods that are protein- and nutrient-rich.
If you’re struggling to eat enough to support your training, consider working with a dietitian for personalized support, Prado suggests.
Keep tabs on your body composition.
Dr. Peralta-Reich regularly monitors her patients’ body composition to prevent significant muscle loss. If she notices a patient is losing too much muscle, for example, she can tweak the dose of their medication or advise them to make other lifestyle or nutrition changes.
Hasan’s doctor does a body composition analysis every time she visits, which allows her to keep tabs on both lean and fat mass. A DEXA scan (which measures lean mass, but not specifically muscle, according to Dr. Neeland) or even an MRI can be the most accurate ways to measure this, but you can also try a scale that measures body comp or even
use a tape measure
.
Talk to your doctor about adjusting your dose.
Maintain open communication with your healthcare provider, as your doctor can help guide you as to whether you’re losing too much muscle and potentially adjust your dose or make other changes.
In the future, there may be other pharmacologic therapies available that people can try in addition to GLP-1s to help prevent muscle loss, Dr. Neeland says. “[Muscle loss] is a side effect that many people don't anticipate or think about, and for some people it doesn't become a big deal, but for others it could.”

Why Trust Us?
I’m a chameleon when it comes to fitness. I don’t limit myself to one particular sport or training method, and at 61 years old, I’m willing (and excited!) to try anything and everything. Between
running
, aerobics, open-water swimming,
obstacle course training
, and adult gymnastics, I’ve devoted my life to health and wellness.
I was born with an adventurous spirit, but I attribute much of my athletic passion to an active childhood. Growing up, I frequently moved around the world since my father was in the army. I’m one of six kids, though, so my siblings and I always kept ourselves entertained playing team sports wherever we were—two teams of three. Whether I was at the park or in my backyard, I was always playing outside and realized from a young age that I felt best when moving my body. I also thrived in gym class.
When I moved for high school, I remember being in awe of my adult neighbor who woke up early and went for a run every morning. I was so impressed with his commitment and discipline, and I knew I wanted to be a runner after witnessing his example and dedication. He was my inspiration, so I bought a pair of
running shoes
and got started.
View full post on Instagram
While I honestly hated running at first, as with most things in life, I knew consistency was key to
building endurance
and I slowly increased my mileage. And, after a few weeks, my body acclimated and I fell in love with running. I had officially caught the fitness bug and never looked back.
Fast-forward to my 60s: So many loved ones, friends, and followers (find me
@baconnfit
!), ask me for my tips and tricks to falling in love with movement and staying so consistent with a fitness routine even in my 60s. So, here are the exact motivation hacks, workout tools and equipment, and mindset shifts I've adopted over the years to stay fit and focused throughout every decade.
View full post on Instagram
1. I constantly change up my routine and challenge myself to learn new modalities and skills.
Although I continued running every morning to kickstart my day, in my 20s (in the era of
Jane Fonda
), I also started regularly teaching aerobics to help support my college tuition. I was always a shy, anxious person, but teaching aerobics made me feel physically and mentally strong.
Aerobics gave me a welcomed confidence boost, and I loved the combination of
cardio
,
light strength training
, and
stretching
. I also appreciated the impact it had on my body. I was building muscle mass, felt overall stronger in daily life, and noticed improvements to my running form and efficiency thanks to the added muscle.
View full post on Instagram
But after 26 years of teaching, I started to burn out on aerobics and knew it was time for a break. I still loved my daily runs, but I was ready for a new challenge. I truly believe that the downfall to a consistent workout routine is boredom.
My daughter was a competitive gymnast as a kid, and to be honest, I was always a little envious of how fun and impressive the sport looked. I always wished I had started training in
gymnastics
in my youth, so at 50 years old, I decided to stop wishing and enrolled in a weekly adult gymnastics class. I was immediately hooked.
View full post on Instagram
The uneven bars were great for building my
upper-body strength
, the beam was key for
balance training
(which is so important as you get older), and the floor was perfect for experimenting with coordination,
mobility
, and agility work. I’m not the most talented gymnast, but I pretend I'm an Olympian and give it my all. Not to mention, it’s incredibly fun and freeing.
People always ask how I stay motivated on my fitness journey, and my answer is simple: Try something new and keep things exciting. Boredom sucks the fun out of fitness, and if you’re disinterested, you’ll never stay committed. My goal is to find activities I love and I’m constantly pushing myself for a new challenge.

"I’m obsessed with my parallette bars and use them every single day," Beth says. "They’re incredibly versatile and perfect for training a variety of upper-body and core exercises"—such as incline or decline pushups, triceps dips, L-sits, and more.
2. I use early-morning workouts as my me time and meditation.
Today, at 61, I still take a weekly gymnastics class. But I continue to run an average of 45 miles a week. I’m a morning person, so I wake up at 4 a.m. and I’m out the door by 4:30 a.m. (I go to sleep at 7:30 p.m.). I run for at least an hour, sometimes alone and sometimes with a running partner, and use it as a
form of meditation
. I live in Florida, so running on the beach is my happy place and a time to collect my thoughts, pray, and set the tone for the day.

3. I strength train regularly to help me stay strong and avoid injury as I age.
Immediately after my daily runs, I always do some form of strength training. I don’t follow a specific, regimented routine, but I have a background in personal training, so every day is a game-time decision depending on how I feel. I love
calisthenic workouts
like pullups, handstands, and muscle-ups since they build strength, balance, flexibility, and control.
View full post on Instagram
Functional lower-body strength and mobility is also key for efficient, injury-free running—so I regularly train
squats
, lunges, and static split squats. I’m officially retired, so depending what I’m working on, I have the luxury of making my workouts anywhere from one to three hours.
While that might seem like a lot, I value the importance of cross-training and recovery. I have my occasional aches and pains, but I’m so thankful that I’ve never had a major injury—and I credit much of that to my commitment to
cross-training
.
Between cardio, strength training, and mobility work, constantly activating different large and small muscles promotes balanced muscle development and reduces the likelihood of overuse injuries.
I’m a firm believer that cross-training keeps my body strong, healthy, and ready to put in the work for whatever I throw at it.

4.
I set realistic, attainable goals.
For example, when I started my gymnastics adventure, my initial goal was to
learn a basic handstand
, though I was terrified to go upside down. But hard things keep me motivated, and I was intensely committed.
I practiced every day, and after
five years
, I built the strength to hold a minute-long handstand. After another six years of consistent practice, I can now walk on my hands and hold handstands on the parallette bars for an added instability challenge.
View full post on Instagram
I love to chase after a goal, but I’m always realistic (although the bar is always high enough that it’s never easy!). As another example, I’ve run 17 marathons in my life, but after an eight-year hiatus, I decided to train for a February 2025
marathon
.
Will I break my personal record from 30 years ago? No. But that’s okay. My goal is to enjoy the training process and do the best I can at my age, injury-free.
I’m a firm believer that you should never stop exploring the possibilities of what you’re capable of. Fitness is ageless.

Why Trust Us?
You realize the importance of a healthy heart and strong muscles, but have you ever thought about training your
bones
?
Nearly 20 percent of women under 30 already showing signs of
low bone density
and conditions like osteopenia and osteoporosis becoming more common as we age (thank you,
menopause
), as reported by the
2023 National Osteoporosis Foundation Survey
. So, shoring up bone health is a nonnegotiable—and a
weighted vest
just might be the tool you didn’t know you needed to do it.
Weighted vests are gaining popularity as a low-impact tool for building bone strength, but understanding the basics of bone health is key before strapping on any extra weight. In this deep dive, we’ll explore how and when to use weighted vests for bone health and osteoporosis prevention–and when not to.
As a physical therapist and certified strength and conditioning specialist, I have seen first-hand how weakened bones can lead to debilitating fractures—but I also know that it’s never too late (or too early!) to start building a stronger skeleton. I’ve also tapped Rachel Ridgeway, CPT, a personal trainer who works with women managing osteoporosis, and Michael Jaasma, PhD, a medical device research and development scientist specializing in bone density issues, to help break down the facts, the risks, and the tips for how to use a weighted vest to build back weakened bones.
Meet the experts
:
Rachel Ridgeway
, CPT, is a personal trainer and owner of
Osteoporosis Trainer
, a bone health-focused fitness program.
Michael Jaasma
, PhD, chief scientific officer and cofounder of
Osteoboost
, a medical device designed to promote bone density.
Bart Clarke, MD
, is an endocrinologist at the Mayo Clinic.
Why You Should Care About Bone Density And Osteoporosis
Think of your bones as living tissue that’s constantly breaking down and rebuilding—this process is called remodeling. During menopause, women experience a reduction in estrogen, which supports bone density, according to the
Bone Health and Osteoporosis Foundation
(BHOF). This decline can lead to a rapid decrease in bone strength, making them more susceptible to fractures. And while a fracture might not sound like a major injury, even a tiny one can set you back in your fitness routine, mobility, independence, and even social involvement—all of which can take a massive toll on your mental and physical well-being, particularly as you age.

But the evidence is clear:

exercises can help strengthen your bones and prevent falls and fractures, making them crucial for all women—especially those with weakened bones.
Osteoporosis, a condition where bones become weak and brittle, affects millions worldwide, with postmenopausal women at the highest risk. The hormonal changes associated with menopause, especially the drop in
estrogen
, contribute to a loss of
bone density
, leading to weaker bones over time.
While aging, genetics,
hormonal changes
play a major role in bone health, lifestyle factors like diet and physical activity are within your control. For instance,
low-calorie diets
and insufficient nutrient intake can negatively affect bone health. The good news? Building bone strength through exercise and a balanced diet is possible at any age, and the sooner you start, the better your chances of maintaining
strong, healthy bones
throughout your life.

How A Weighted Vest Can Be A Boon For Bone Health
Applying gentle,
progressive stress
via
resistance training
signals your body to build stronger bones and muscles. Bones strengthen in response to stress, so consistent use of a weighted vest may help maintain or improve bone density over time, says Ridgeway, who works with women managing low bone density. A weighted vest helps do this by adding resistance to just about any exercise (the
squat
, for example), without the need to grab
free weights
. While research is a little unclear on whether weighted vests alone improve bone density, the science shows they can enhance the effectiveness of
strength training
,
cardio
, and
HIIT workouts
by increasing the load on your  body, says Ridgeway.
Weighted vests essentially increase your body weight by 5 to 10 percent (depending on the weight of the vest) to increase the intensity of exercise, says Jaasma. However, the benefits for bone health depend more on  the types of exercises you perform while wearing the vest, rather than the vest itself, he says. Weighted vests are great for boosting the cardiovascular and muscle-strengthening impact of workouts, but they're not a one-stop solution for better bone health, Jaasma says.
A weighted vest is a great way to add resistance to activities like
walking
and strength training, but pairing it with the right exercises and lifestyle habits is key to reaping bone health benefits, Jaasma says. Adding external resistance, like a weighted vest, can be a safe and effective way to combat bone density loss in postmenopausal women, according to a 2022 study in
Contemporary Clinical Trials
, but they’re “not a cure for osteoporosis,” he says. Instead, think of weighted vests as a tool in a broader plan to support bone health.

The best thing about the growing  popularity of weighted vests is it has gotten more women thinking about how to support strong bones daily, consistent efforts, which is a huge win. Ultimately, the benefit is that weighted vests can help women take meaningful steps toward changing the alarming rates of osteoporosis. While not a silver bullet, they’re a step in the right direction.
The Best Weighted Vests For Beginners
Not all weighted vests are created equal, especially when it comes to supporting bone health. For beginners, it’s essential to choose a vest that’s comfortable, adjustable, and light enough to ease into safely. Here are some of our top-rated options to help you get started:

How To Use A Weighted Vest Safely And Effectively
A weighted vest might not be for everyone, both Ridgeway and Jaasma say. If you're uncertain if it's safe for you—particularly if you have been diagnosed with bone density issues—consult your healthcare provider before using one. For some women with severe osteoporosis, wearing a weighted vest may be counter-productive, increasing one’s risk of spinal compression fractures or falls rather than lowering it, says Ridgeway.
If you are cleared by your doctor to move forward with using a weighted vest, here are some things to keep in mind:
Start light, and progress gradually.
Start with 5 percent of your bodyweight, and only increase it when this load starts to feel easy, says Ridgeway. “Most people can safely work up to 5 to 10 percent of their body weight over time,” she says. Try adding it to exercises that you’re already comfortable and familiar with before wearing it for an exercise or workout that is new to you.
Choose the right exercises.
While walking may not be enough load-bearing exercise on its own to stimulate bones to build back stronger over time, it’s a good activity to help you get used to wearing a vest. Other exercises you can try while using a weighted vest are
bodyweight exercises
like
squats
, step-ups,
lunges
, and even
hiking
.
Focus on progressive overload.
Don’t forget to progress your workout overtime with additional resistance. Whether you are adding more weight to your vest (many are adjustable!) or integrating more challenging exercises to your routine, bone responds to progressive loading, so you should continue upping the challenge of your workout as you get stronger if you want to see continued benefits.
Be mindful of form and move with control.
Any time you add weight to an exercise, maintaining good form becomes even more critical. Always be mindful you are keeping good posture and have form in-check before adding weight to any exercise, says Ridgeway.
Core and upper-back strength
is important to help you support the added forces of a weighted vest and not let it alter your posture, causing you to slump or slouch your
shoulders
and
upper body
. If you notice your posture is slipping when wearing a weighted vest, it might be too heavy for you.
Avoid certain positions.
Stay away from forward- or backward-bending or twisting movements while wearing a weighted vest, as these can increase your fracture risk, particularly in the spine, Ridgeway says. Also, be mindful of your posture when using one for extended periods of time. An exercise might feel easy when you first put on a vest, but that same exercise may feel really difficult after 30 minutes under the added weight of a vest—listen to your body and adjust accordingly.
Stop if you feel pain.
Wearing a weighted vest should not cause any pain, ever, says Ridgeway. If you experience any pain or discomfort, stop using it immediately.
Trainer tip
: Take off the weighted vest for any exercises that require lying on your back (supine position) or lying on your stomach (prone position). Weighted vests work best for exercises that do not position them in direct contact with the floor.
Are there risks or limitations with using a weighted vest for osteoporosis?
As with any kind of added weight or exercise, there are a few risks to be aware of when using a weighted vest–especially for women with compromised or weakened bones.
A weighted vest can increase your risk of injury if you have any of the following:
Diagnosis of osteoporosis
History or presence of vertebral fractures
Thoracic kyphosis (rounded upper back) or other postural abnormalities
Poor balance
Impaired vision
“Weighted vests aren’t recommended for those with severe osteoporosis or vertebral fractures,” Ridgeway says. “Always consult your healthcare provider before using one if you're uncertain if it's safe for you.”
But the risks associated with weighted vests are relatively low for the general public, says Jaasma. “The main risk I see [is] the potential to fall, and higher forces on bones when falling, due to the added weight.” Falls are a main cause of hip fractures, which can have severe consequences, so “it’s something everyone should be cognizant of.”
