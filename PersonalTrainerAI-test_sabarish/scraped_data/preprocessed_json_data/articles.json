The second is to take your time sustainable weight loss happens slowly but steadily. Before you set out on your effort, make sure you know exactly what youre trying to achieve. Ask yourself, How much weight do I need to lose to be healthy? Then set personalized goals in achievable increments, and introduce lifestyle changes to gradually lose weight and keep it off. Be prepared to adapt your lifestyle as necessary to maximize your chances of success. On this page youll discover Its a question on the minds of most people once theyve decided they need to shed some poundswhat is the best diet for weight loss? While thats not an unreasonable question, it often implies an approach that is less than optimal, which is to plan on adopting a radically restrictive mode of eating for a while until the weight is lost, and then going back to eating as normal. Instead of embracing fad diets, people who have lost weight and kept it off usually have made a permanent shift toward healthier eating habits. Simply replacing unhealthy foods with healthy ones not for a few weeks, but forever will help you achieve weight loss while also offering numerous other benefits. So a better set of questions might be, What is a healthy diet? What does a healthy diet look like? A healthy diet favors natural, unprocessed foods over prepackaged meals and snacks. It is balanced, meaning that it provides your body with all the nutrients and minerals it needs to function best. It emphasizes plantbased foods, especially fruits and vegetables, over animal foods. It contains plenty of protein. It is low in sugar and salt. It incorporates healthy fats including fish, olive oil, and other plantderived oils. Here are a few examples of healthy meals for weight loss. For breakfast, a bowl of bran flakes with sliced strawberries and walnuts with nonfat milk. For lunch, a turkey sandwich on wheat with vegetables and an olive oil and vinegar dressing. For dinner, a salmon steak on a bed of spinach. You dont have to cut out snacks in order to eat a healthy diet, either. Healthy snacks for weight loss include almonds or pistachios, string cheese with an apple, Greek yogurt, or a banana with peanut butter. Before you begin your weightloss journey, do some brainstorming about the kinds of healthy foods you enjoy so that you can have lots of choices as you plan your meals and snacks. Remember that the best diet is the one youll stick to, so dont rush out and buy a bunch of health foods that you know youll never eat. There is no single diet that nutritionists have deemed the healthiest. However, there are several styles of eating that experts either have designed for optimal health or have observed to be healthy when consumed traditionally by different people around the world. Such styles of eating tend to have a few things in common they tend to be plantbased diets they emphasize healthy fats, no simple sugars, and low sodium and they favor natural foods over the highly processed fare typical of much of the Western diet. For example,the Mediterraneanstyle dietgets its name from the foods available to various cultures located around the Mediterranean Sea. It heavily emphasizes minimally processed fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, and whole grains. It contains moderate amounts of yogurt, cheese, poultry, and fish. Olive oil is its primary cooking fat. Red meat and foods with added sugars are only eaten sparingly. Besides being an effective weight loss method, eating a Mediterraneanstyle diet is linked to a lower risk of heart disease, diabetes, depression, and some forms of cancer. Experts developedthe DASH dietDietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension specifically as a hearthealthy regimen. The combination of food types contained in the diet seem to work together especially effectively to lower blood pressure and decrease risk of heart failure. The key features of DASH are low cholesterol and saturated fats lots of magnesium, calcium, fiber, and potassium and little to no red meat and sugar. Unsurprisingly, that equates to a list of foods similar to those of the Mediterranean diet whole grains, vegetables, fruits, fish, poultry, nuts, and olive oil. As its name implies, the MIND diet MediterraneanDASH diet Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay was designed by doctors to take elements from the Mediterranean and DASH diets that seemed to provide benefits to brain health and stave off dementia and cognitive decline. In practice, it is very similar to both the Mediterranean and DASH diets, but it puts stronger emphasis on leafy green vegetables and berries, and less emphasis on fruit and dairy. In recent years, the Nordic diet has emerged as both a weightloss and healthmaintenance diet. Based on Scandinavian eating patterns, the Nordic diet is heavy on fish, apples, pears, whole grains such as rye and oats, and coldclimate vegetables including cabbage, carrots, and cauliflower. Studies have supported its use both in preventing stroke and in weight loss. What do all of these diets have in common? Theyre all good for your heart, they all consist of natural unprocessed foods, and they all contain plenty of plantbased dishes. Eating for your health especially your heart health by adopting elements from these diets is a smart way to lose weight. Youve probably heard some inspiring success stories aboutintermittent fasting. But is fasting healthy, and does intermittent fasting work? Fasting abstaining from eating for some period of time is an ancient practice that is safe when not taken to extremes. Traditionally, the benefits of fasting have been both spiritual and physical. People who fast for religious reasons often report a stronger focus on spiritual matters during the fast. Physically, a simple fast lowers blood sugar, reduces inflammation, improves metabolism, clears out toxins from damaged cells, and has been linked to lower risk of cancer, reduced pain from arthritis, and enhanced brain function. Intermittent fasting means dividing ones time between eating windows and periods of abstention on a regular basis. A common intermittent fasting schedule might restrict eating to the hours of 700 a.m. to 300 p.m., with the remaining 16 hours of the day spent fasting. But there is no specific, prescribed schedule. Some people have more or less generous eating windows, setting the rule that they will not eat after, say, 800 p.m. or, on the considerably less generous side, only allowing themselves to eat every other day. The science behind intermittent fasting is based on altering the bodys metabolism. During a period without eating, insulin levels drop to the point that the body begins burning fat for fuel. Additionally, the thinking goes, by slowing the bodys metabolism, you cause your appetite to drop off and thus will consume fewer calories when you resume eating. Numerous studies have demonstrated the benefits of intermittent fasting for weight loss. However, its not clear that it is any more effective than simply restricting calories and following a normal eating schedule. One possible reason for the success of intermittent fasting is that most practitioners have quit the habit of eating during the late evening and night hours. Restricting eating to earlier in the day aligns better with our bodies circadian rhythms, and is less likely to cause us to store our food in fat cells. Since intermittent fasting is difficult for many people to adhere to, a wise alternative might be to consume a lowcalorie Mediterranean diet and to stop the days eating in late afternoon. There are certain people who should not try intermittent fasting without first checking with their doctor, such those with diabetes or heart disease. Intermittent fasting is a very lifestyleintensive dietary pattern, meaning that it is challenging to maintain in the face of normal social relationships. If the rest of your family is eating while youre fasting, you might be tempted to indulge or to surrender to the familymeal ritual. If your job requires you to dine with clients or colleagues, youll find an intermittent fasting schedule difficult to maintain. Remember that the best healthy eating plan is the one youll stick to. It sounds counterintuitive, but many people find success losing weight, especially initially, by eating more fat, not less. Called a ketogenic orKeto diet, this method requires shifting the main source of calories over to fatty foods between 75 and 90 of what you eat, with only 10 to 20 of your calories coming from protein and a mere 5 from carbohydrates. The theory is that by eating so many healthy fats and restricting carbohydrates, you enter an altered metabolic state in which you force your body to begin relying on fat for energy, burning away your fat stores instead of sugar for fuel. Research does show that keto is an effective way to jumpstart weight loss and improve bloodsugar levels. However, it is hard to maintain, and to date we are lacking longterm studies that show it to be a sustainable eating pattern for keeping weight off. Because both weight loss and overall health are tied to some basic eating patterns, we have developedthe Harvard Healthy Eating Plateas a model for meal planning and for your overall balanced diet. Imagine a round dinner plate with a line running vertically down its center dividing it evenly in two. One half of the plate should be taken up by equal portions of whole grains not refined grains like white bread and white rice and healthy protesuch as fish, nuts, beans, and poultry not red meat or processed meats. Twothirds of the other half should be filled with vegetables, with the remaining portion consisting of fruit. Try to inject a lot of variety into this half of your plate or half of your diet eat fruits in a variety of colors and vegetables of all types but dont count potatoes or French fries as vegetables. To one side of the plate, picture a glass of water, since thats the best drink for weight loss and for overall health at some meals you can substitute coffee or tea with little to no sugar. Dont drink more than a serving or two of milk each day. To the other side of the plate, imagine a vessel containing healthy oils such as canola or olive oil. Use it for cooking or at the table instead of butter. Remember the Healthy Eating Platewhen youre contemplating what to eat for a specific meal, when youre grocery shopping, or when youre strategizing about how to lose weight and keep it off. Adhering to its guidelines will optimize your chances of remaining healthy and of maintaining a desirable body weight. Flowers, chocolates, organ donation are you in?

Yet more than 160 million Americans are on a diet at any given time, and we drop more than 70 billion each year on commercial weightloss plans, supplements, and other poundshedding measures. That suggests that losing weight is not easy yet it is entirely possible when done right. There are two keys to success when it comes to weight loss.

The second is to take your time sustainable weight loss happens slowly but steadily. Before you set out on your effort, make sure you know exactly what youre trying to achieve. Ask yourself, How much weight do I need to lose to be healthy? Then set personalized goals in achievable increments, and introduce lifestyle changes to gradually lose weight and keep it off. Be prepared to adapt your lifestyle as necessary to maximize your chances of success. On this page youll discover Its a question on the minds of most people once theyve decided they need to shed some poundswhat is the best diet for weight loss? While thats not an unreasonable question, it often implies an approach that is less than optimal, which is to plan on adopting a radically restrictive mode of eating for a while until the weight is lost, and then going back to eating as normal. Instead of embracing fad diets, people who have lost weight and kept it off usually have made a permanent shift toward healthier eating habits. Simply replacing unhealthy foods with healthy ones not for a few weeks, but forever will help you achieve weight loss while also offering numerous other benefits. So a better set of questions might be, What is a healthy diet? What does a healthy diet look like? A healthy diet favors natural, unprocessed foods over prepackaged meals and snacks. It is balanced, meaning that it provides your body with all the nutrients and minerals it needs to function best. It emphasizes plantbased foods, especially fruits and vegetables, over animal foods. It contains plenty of protein. It is low in sugar and salt. It incorporates healthy fats including fish, olive oil, and other plantderived oils. Here are a few examples of healthy meals for weight loss. For breakfast, a bowl of bran flakes with sliced strawberries and walnuts with nonfat milk. For lunch, a turkey sandwich on wheat with vegetables and an olive oil and vinegar dressing. For dinner, a salmon steak on a bed of spinach. You dont have to cut out snacks in order to eat a healthy diet, either. Healthy snacks for weight loss include almonds or pistachios, string cheese with an apple, Greek yogurt, or a banana with peanut butter. Before you begin your weightloss journey, do some brainstorming about the kinds of healthy foods you enjoy so that you can have lots of choices as you plan your meals and snacks. Remember that the best diet is the one youll stick to, so dont rush out and buy a bunch of health foods that you know youll never eat. There is no single diet that nutritionists have deemed the healthiest. However, there are several styles of eating that experts either have designed for optimal health or have observed to be healthy when consumed traditionally by different people around the world. Such styles of eating tend to have a few things in common they tend to be plantbased diets they emphasize healthy fats, no simple sugars, and low sodium and they favor natural foods over the highly processed fare typical of much of the Western diet. For example,the Mediterraneanstyle dietgets its name from the foods available to various cultures located around the Mediterranean Sea. It heavily emphasizes minimally processed fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, and whole grains. It contains moderate amounts of yogurt, cheese, poultry, and fish. Olive oil is its primary cooking fat. Red meat and foods with added sugars are only eaten sparingly. Besides being an effective weight loss method, eating a Mediterraneanstyle diet is linked to a lower risk of heart disease, diabetes, depression, and some forms of cancer. Experts developedthe DASH dietDietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension specifically as a hearthealthy regimen. The combination of food types contained in the diet seem to work together especially effectively to lower blood pressure and decrease risk of heart failure. The key features of DASH are low cholesterol and saturated fats lots of magnesium, calcium, fiber, and potassium and little to no red meat and sugar. Unsurprisingly, that equates to a list of foods similar to those of the Mediterranean diet whole grains, vegetables, fruits, fish, poultry, nuts, and olive oil. As its name implies, the MIND diet MediterraneanDASH diet Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay was designed by doctors to take elements from the Mediterranean and DASH diets that seemed to provide benefits to brain health and stave off dementia and cognitive decline. In practice, it is very similar to both the Mediterranean and DASH diets, but it puts stronger emphasis on leafy green vegetables and berries, and less emphasis on fruit and dairy. In recent years, the Nordic diet has emerged as both a weightloss and healthmaintenance diet. Based on Scandinavian eating patterns, the Nordic diet is heavy on fish, apples, pears, whole grains such as rye and oats, and coldclimate vegetables including cabbage, carrots, and cauliflower. Studies have supported its use both in preventing stroke and in weight loss. What do all of these diets have in common? Theyre all good for your heart, they all consist of natural unprocessed foods, and they all contain plenty of plantbased dishes. Eating for your health especially your heart health by adopting elements from these diets is a smart way to lose weight. Youve probably heard some inspiring success stories aboutintermittent fasting. But is fasting healthy, and does intermittent fasting work? Fasting abstaining from eating for some period of time is an ancient practice that is safe when not taken to extremes. Traditionally, the benefits of fasting have been both spiritual and physical. People who fast for religious reasons often report a stronger focus on spiritual matters during the fast. Physically, a simple fast lowers blood sugar, reduces inflammation, improves metabolism, clears out toxins from damaged cells, and has been linked to lower risk of cancer, reduced pain from arthritis, and enhanced brain function. Intermittent fasting means dividing ones time between eating windows and periods of abstention on a regular basis. A common intermittent fasting schedule might restrict eating to the hours of 700 a.m. to 300 p.m., with the remaining 16 hours of the day spent fasting. But there is no specific, prescribed schedule. Some people have more or less generous eating windows, setting the rule that they will not eat after, say, 800 p.m. or, on the considerably less generous side, only allowing themselves to eat every other day. The science behind intermittent fasting is based on altering the bodys metabolism. During a period without eating, insulin levels drop to the point that the body begins burning fat for fuel. Additionally, the thinking goes, by slowing the bodys metabolism, you cause your appetite to drop off and thus will consume fewer calories when you resume eating. Numerous studies have demonstrated the benefits of intermittent fasting for weight loss. However, its not clear that it is any more effective than simply restricting calories and following a normal eating schedule. One possible reason for the success of intermittent fasting is that most practitioners have quit the habit of eating during the late evening and night hours. Restricting eating to earlier in the day aligns better with our bodies circadian rhythms, and is less likely to cause us to store our food in fat cells. Since intermittent fasting is difficult for many people to adhere to, a wise alternative might be to consume a lowcalorie Mediterranean diet and to stop the days eating in late afternoon. There are certain people who should not try intermittent fasting without first checking with their doctor, such those with diabetes or heart disease. Intermittent fasting is a very lifestyleintensive dietary pattern, meaning that it is challenging to maintain in the face of normal social relationships. If the rest of your family is eating while youre fasting, you might be tempted to indulge or to surrender to the familymeal ritual. If your job requires you to dine with clients or colleagues, youll find an intermittent fasting schedule difficult to maintain. Remember that the best healthy eating plan is the one youll stick to. It sounds counterintuitive, but many people find success losing weight, especially initially, by eating more fat, not less. Called a ketogenic orKeto diet, this method requires shifting the main source of calories over to fatty foods between 75 and 90 of what you eat, with only 10 to 20 of your calories coming from protein and a mere 5 from carbohydrates. The theory is that by eating so many healthy fats and restricting carbohydrates, you enter an altered metabolic state in which you force your body to begin relying on fat for energy, burning away your fat stores instead of sugar for fuel. Research does show that keto is an effective way to jumpstart weight loss and improve bloodsugar levels. However, it is hard to maintain, and to date we are lacking longterm studies that show it to be a sustainable eating pattern for keeping weight off. Because both weight loss and overall health are tied to some basic eating patterns, we have developedthe Harvard Healthy Eating Plateas a model for meal planning and for your overall balanced diet. Imagine a round dinner plate with a line running vertically down its center dividing it evenly in two. One half of the plate should be taken up by equal portions of whole grains not refined grains like white bread and white rice and healthy protesuch as fish, nuts, beans, and poultry not red meat or processed meats. Twothirds of the other half should be filled with vegetables, with the remaining portion consisting of fruit. Try to inject a lot of variety into this half of your plate or half of your diet eat fruits in a variety of colors and vegetables of all types but dont count potatoes or French fries as vegetables. To one side of the plate, picture a glass of water, since thats the best drink for weight loss and for overall health at some meals you can substitute coffee or tea with little to no sugar. Dont drink more than a serving or two of milk each day. To the other side of the plate, imagine a vessel containing healthy oils such as canola or olive oil. Use it for cooking or at the table instead of butter. Remember the Healthy Eating Platewhen youre contemplating what to eat for a specific meal, when youre grocery shopping, or when youre strategizing about how to lose weight and keep it off. Adhering to its guidelines will optimize your chances of remaining healthy and of maintaining a desirable body weight. Flowers, chocolates, organ donation are you in?

The drugs not only lower blood sugar and weight, but also quiet inflammation, stimulate the production of antioxidants, help repair damaged DNA, and slow the aging of the bodys cells. Evidence suggests that among people who use the drugs for diabetes and obesity, the drugs reduce the risks of kidney disease progression, heart attack, death from heart disease, death from COVID19, and death from all causes by 15 to 35. Intermittent fasting is a weightloss approach that involves not eating for a designated amount of time over the course of the day. One popular approach is called 168. Here, people eat during an eighthour period followed by 16 hours of fasting. Intermittent fasting is often used to help with weight loss by placing the body in shortterm ketosis, where the body burns fat for energy. While the supporting research is mixed, theres not much downside to trying intermittent fasting, and it also may help people manage their eating habits. A 2024 study of people ages 80 and older suggested that following healthy habitslike eating a diversified diet that includes high amounts of fruits, vegetables, fish, beans, and tea regularly exercising and not smokingcan help people live longer. Compared with white rice, brown rice contains much higher amounts of fiber, certain B vitamins, magnesium, potassium, and iron. Research suggests that swapping white rice for brown rice may improve blood sugar levels and help with weight control. If youre struggling with depression, the most important question about taking an antidepressant is whether it will work. But another question on your mind may be whether it will fuel weight gain. A new study provides some context. Some people with diabetes use a device that continuously monitors the level of blood sugar. The monitor sends the information wirelessly to another device, such as a smartphone, so the person can easily see the blood sugar level. As of 2024, there is no solid evidence that these monitors can help people who do not have diabetes. However, the monitors may one day prove to be useful in people with diabetes risk factors, such as obesity, prediabetes, or a family history of diabetes. Being a night owl might increase the risk of developing many health problems, so it might be worth it for night owls to go to sleep a little earlier. The sleep schedule must be shifted slowly to make a lasting change. Tips to do that include setting a bedtime goal between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m. going to sleep 20 minutes earlier every five days, until the bedtime goal is reached possibly using certain sleep aids until the bedtime goal is reached and setting a consistent wake time no later than 9 a.m. Flowers, chocolates, organ donation are you in?

Each has its unique approach and some may help jumpstart a weightloss program, But longterm use of very lowcarb diets can lack essential micronutrients and may raise the risk of health problems. Intermittent fasting may help people lose weight and improve their cholesterol levels and other heartrelated risks. One form of intermittent fasting is timerestricted eating, during which people eat only during a certain time window usually eight hours each day. Another approach, alternateday fasting, involves fasting or significantly limiting calories for one or two days per week. But its hard to maintain over the long run due to the challenges of following a strict eating schedule while juggling various work, family, and social commitments. People who are at high risk for cardiovascular disease can benefit from driving down bad lowdensity lipoprotein LDL cholesterol levels as low as possible to help reduce their risk for heart attacks and strokes. Guidelines recommend that people at high risk aim for LDL levels below 70 milligrams per deciliter mgdL. The general population should strive for levels below 100 mgdL. Taking statins and adopting healthier lifestyle habits like following a plantbased diet and increasing exercise can help manage LDL levels. According to a 2024 review, the ketogenic keto dietwhich is high in fat and protein and low in carbohydratesdoesnt meet standards for a healthy diet and may not be safe for some people with heart disease. The demand for semaglutide Wegovy, Ozempic and similar weightloss drugs has renewed interest in the dietary supplement berberine. Some people say berberine suppresses appetite and promotes weight loss, but no rigorous evidence supports that claim. Up to 30 of Americans have abovenormal levels of triglycerides, which many studies have linked to a higher risk of heart disease. Lifestyle changes that can lower triglycerides include losing weight if needed avoiding simple carbohydrates, sweets, and alcohol cutting back on saturated fats and doing regular exercise. For people whose levels remain high especially those at risk for heart disease, medications such as fibrates or icosapent ethyl Vascepa may be helpful. Standard definitions consider a healthy body mass index BMI, a calculation based on a persons height and weight, as between 18.5 and 24.9. Studies have found that a higher BMI increases risk for heart disease, diabetes, and some types of cancer. However, even if their BMI does not fall into the category of overweight, people who gain five or more pounds may be at risk for health problems, especially if the weight gain is belly fat. The best approach is a combination of aerobic exercise, strength training, and a healthy diet. Flowers, chocolates, organ donation are you in?

When that happens, their risk of heart disease and kidney disease declines, according to a 2024 study. A 2023 study suggests that avoiding lowquality carbohydrates such as refined grains, sugarsweetened drinks, and starchy vegetables may help middleaged adults avoid weight gain. Though the visceral fat that lies behind the abdominal wall makes up only a small percentage of the bodys fat, a growing body of research indicates that it is linked to a number of diseases and conditions. Compared with analog scales, digital scales are more accurate and easier to read. Many smart scales include added features such as smartphone connectivity and body composition estimates. If youve ever tried to lose weight, youve probably heard the advice to drink water before a meal because it makes you feel fuller and youll stop eating sooner. It seems like a reasonable idea but does it work? And if it doesnt, why do people think it does? Metabolic syndrome is a constellation of interrelated health conditions that significantly increases the risk for heart attacks, strokes, diabetes, and more. A diagnosis requires at least three of the following risk factors obesity, high blood sugar, high triglycerides, low HDL good cholesterol, or high blood pressure. Metabolic syndrome can be reversed if its recognized. Losing weight is central to reducing many of its features. Lowering elevated blood pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol levels also plays a major role in reducing the risk for heart disease and stroke. Excessive beer drinking may play a role in mens experiencing expanding girth known as a beer belly. However, most experts believe the two primary reasons are eating too many simple carbohydrates and getting less daily exercise. The start of a new year is always a great opportunity for people to reengage with their health. One of the first steps is to conduct a personal health review. Its a way to measure where a persons health stands now, outline the goals, and create a strategy to reach them. A personal health review follows a threestep process gathering all current health information, listing short and longterm goals, and sharing everything with a doctor during a scheduled wellness visit. A large waistline 35 inches or more in women or 40 inches or more in men can signal the presence of visceral fat. Located deep within the abdominal cavity, visceral fat pads the space around the organs and is closely linked to cardiovascular problems. Getting regular exercise both aerobic and strengthbased and following a healthy, reducedcarbohydrate diet can help reduce visceral fat. Timerestricted eating may also help.

Image Thinkstock Cocoa flavanols in chocolate are linked to improved thinking skills and better heart health. Theyre linked to calorie absorption, high blood pressure, and heart trouble. For weightconscious people who love the bite of carbonation and the taste of various soft drinks, the advent of sugarfree sodas 60 years ago seemed a blessing if there were no calories, you didnt have to worry about weight gainand the diseases that go along with obesity, like diabetes and heart disease. But there are growing doubts about whether diet sodas really help people lose weight and avoid diabetes, says Dr. Anthony Komaroff, editor in chief of theHealth Letter. Weightloss drugs arent for people hoping to lose just a few pounds. Image Thinkstock Some firstgeneration diet pills proved risky to the heart. New drugs may have expanded the options for treating obesity. You can get some of the same benefits of a lowglycemicindex diet by avoiding highly processed foods. The glycemic index is a number that indicates how rapidly the body digests a particular type of food and converts it into blood sugar glucose. Some studies suggest that lowerglycemicindex diets may offer important health benefits for menlike a reduced risk of heart disease and diabetes. A study published in the Jan. 27, 2015, issue ofThe BMJchallenges the longstanding notion that weight gain protects against postmenopausal fractures. Data from the Womens Health Initiative WHI indicate that weight gain, as well as weight loss, is associated with increased risk of fractures in postmenopausal women. The analysis also suggested that which bones were most likely to break depended on whether women have gained or lost weight. WHI researchers analyzed data on over 120,000 healthy postmenopausal women ages 50 to 79 at the start of the study. Each year, participants were weighed and asked to report fractures of their arms, legs, hip, pelvis, and spine. Images Thinkstock Aerobic exercise is not enough to fight belly fat, according to researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health. They say that weight training is also key to fighting the battle of the bulge. Researchers analyzed physical activity, weight, and waist circumference data for more than 10,000 men ages 40 and older, and found that healthy men who did 20 minutes of daily weight training had less of an increase in agerelated abdominal fat compared with men who spent the same amount of time doing aerobic activities. Aerobic exercise alone was associated with less weight gain compared with weight training. The best results came from combining weight training and aerobic activity. The findings were published online Dec. 22, 2014, inObesity. Engaging in weight training or, ideally, combining it with aerobic exercise could help older adults lessen abdominal fat while increasing or preserving muscle mass, says Dr. Rania Mekary, the studys lead author and a researcher in Harvards Department of Nutrition. Abdominal fat is linked to heart disease, diabetes, bone loss, and decreased bone strength. You can fight back by aiming for the recommended 150 minutes of moderateintensity exercise per week and starting a weighttraining program if your doctor approves. Coffee drinkers around the world savor the bitter brew on a daily basis. But are there any grounds for concern regarding coffees effects on the heart? On the contrary the case for drinking coffee seems to be growing. Straight coffeeminus the cream and sugaris a nearly caloriefree beverage brimming with antioxidants. It might ease arterydamaging inflammation and may deliver a substance that helps the body regulate blood sugar. The evidence for the benefits of coffee consumption is even more convincing than it was five years ago, especially when it comes to preventing type 2 diabetes and reducing risk of heart disease and stroke, says Dr. Frank Hu, professor of nutrition and epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health. Cutting back on carbohydrates can help shrink a bulging midriff. Pants getting a little snug? Its not just you Americans waistlines have ballooned over the past decade or so, to an average of just under 40 inches for men and almost 38 inches for women, according to a large federal study. The proper role of fat in diet is not that complicated. Atkins, South Beach, paleo, highprotein, lowcarb, glutenfreethe march of the media darlings of dieting never ceases, along with the scientific controversy over which one works best.

But theyre expensive, scarce, and not right for everyone. Learn more about the latest batch of antiobesity drugs. Food products advertised as being lower in sugar or sugarfree contain sugar substitutes. Sugar alcohol is another ingredient used as a sweetener in food products. But is sugar alcohol a better choice nutritionally than other sweeteners or natural sugar? A 2023 analysis suggests that men older than age 70 can fight declining testosterone levels by engaging more in healthy lifestyle behaviors like increasing exercise, losing weight, and managing high blood pressure. A 2023 study found that people who exercise in the morning, specifically between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., have a lower risk of obesity than those who are most active in the midday or evening. Many men diagnosed with lowgrade prostate cancer follow active surveillance, in which they regularly follow up with a doctor for routine PSA tests, prostate biopsies, and possibly MRI scans. If there is evidence their cancer has progressed, then they can consider treatment radiation or surgery. While there is little men can do to slow the growth of known lowgrade prostate cancer, losing excess weight and keeping it off may help keep undetected high or mediumgrade cancer from becoming more aggressive. Semaglutide Ozempic, Wegovy, which mimics a natural hormone called GLP1, has become a popular obesity drug because it promotes dramatic weight loss. New evidence suggests this drug and others like it may also curb compulsions for things other than food. The drugs may also dampen cravings for alcohol, smoking, gambling, and excessive shopping by hampering activation of the brains reward pathways. If further research confirms preliminary findings, the demand for GLP1 drugs is likely to increase. A newer class of medications used to treat type 2 diabetes called glucagonlike peptide1 GLP1 receptor agonists has gained attention because of their impressive weightloss resultsin many cases, 10 to 20 of a persons body weight. Versions of two of these GLP1 receptor agonists, liraglutide Saxenda and semaglutide Wegovy, are FDAapproved for weight loss, even for people without diabetes. However, there isnt enough evidence to know whether these drugs might be beneficial or dangerous for people who are not diagnosed with diabetes or obesity. Many common wellness myths contain a grain of truth but are misleading over all. One wellness myth holds that being thin equates to being healthy, but people who are think can still be unhealthy. Another myth posits that detoxes and cleanses can help people be healthier, but these products dont help and can even be dangerous for some people. Another myth is that eating before bedtime leads to weight gain, but food choice matters more than timing. A high intake of sugar is linked to an increased risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancers. But whether some sugars are healthier or worse than others remains a question of interest to many. Flowers, chocolates, organ donation are you in?

Type 2 diabetes is a major cause of vision loss and blindness, kidney failure requiring dialysis, heart attacks, strokes, amputations, infections, and even early death. Research suggests that a healthy lifestyle can prevent diabetes from occurring in the first place, and even reverse its progress. Losing 5 of ones total body weight can result in clinically significant physiologic changes. For example, losing a little weight can reduce heartburn, knee pain, blood pressure, and diabetes risk. Losing 5 of ones body weight may also lead to better sexual function, more restorative sleep, extra energy, and more selfesteem. To reach a 5 reduction in total body weight, it helps to exercise eat a healthy diet rich in lean proteins, whole grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, and seeds and get enough sleep. For people who have risk factors for heart disease, its important to make lifestyle changes like losing weight, getting more exercise, and eating a healthier diet. Longstanding habits are hard to change, but managing the challenge of healthy eating is easier if people have a partner who is supportive and involved in making food choices. For older adults who cant always go to the store, its smart to keep the freezer stocked with healthy, fresh foods all year through. Staples include a variety of proteins meat, poultry, and seafood, fruits, and vegetables. Fitness trackers accurately record objective data about physical activity, including the pace, distance, intensity, and duration of exercise. Knowing that something is keeping track of every move can motivate people to stick with a workout. There are several types of dietary fat. Some fats are unhealthy, such as trans fat and saturated fat. Polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fat are healthy. The reason for weight gain isnt always as obvious as inactivity or a poor diet. Weight gain can stem from many other causes. For example, it might reflect agerelated physiological changes such as muscle loss, poor sleep, or changes in sex hormone levels underlying conditions such as diabetes or sleep apnea side effects from taking certain medications, such as antidepressants or beta blockers or possibly the effects of eating late at night or the makeup of gut bacteria. Recent or excessive weight gain warrants a visit to a doctor to help pinpoint the issue. As men age, their metabolism naturally slows, and they burn calories more slowly. They can be less active and consume extra calories. The result is a buildup of visceral fat inside the abdominal cavity and around vital organs. This can raise heart disease risk factors, such as blood pressure, blood sugar, and total cholesterol levels. The best way to fight visceral fat is with aerobic exercise, strength training, and a healthy diet that includes plenty of protein. Men often confront obstacles that keep them from managing heart disease or lowering their risk for it. Harvard cardiologists share the advice they give patients who face challenges in the areas of weight loss, medication management, exercise, and diet. These include thinking about their future health goals, monitoring blood pressure, scheduling workouts, joining group weightloss groups, and learning portion control for meals.

A higher body mass index BMI is a major risk factor for osteoarthritis, but a 2023 study suggests it is also associated with inflammatory joint conditions including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, gout, and inflammatory spondylitis. Drinking apple cider vinegar before bedtime isnt proven to curb appetite or promote weight loss. Doing so can also lead to heartburn or reflux and erode tooth enamel. To consume it more safely, people can blend apple cider vinegar with water or into salad dressings. Its common for indigestion to become more frequent and severe with age, a condition called chronic dyspepsia or recurring indigestion. While most flareups can be treated with overthecounter remedies, people can stop recurring problems by adopting lifestyle measures, such as reducing stress, avoiding excess alcohol, quitting smoking, losing extra weight, and eating smaller meals. A 2023 study suggests that some brain changes in people with obesity appear similar to those that occur in people with Alzheimers disease, the most common cause of dementia. Many claim that apple cider vinegar aids in weight loss, but theres little proof that it works. Heres what we know. Learn to manage your triglyceride levels to avoid having a higher risk of heart disease and stroke. Body mass index BMI is a calculation of your size that expresses the relationship between your height and weight as a single number. Its useful for a person to know, but research shows that BMI on its own frequently misclassifies a persons metabolic health. Medication to lower high blood pressure is a proven way to reduce a persons risk for heart disease. But adopting lifestyle changes may let people maintain healthy readings and perhaps even avoid drug therapy. Six lifestyle changes have the most significant influence on blood pressure diet, exercise, weight control, limiting sodium and alcohol, and managing stress.

A 2022 nationally representative poll indicated that nearly one in five older women reported symptoms of addiction to highly processed foods and drinks over the prior year. In people with obesity, a highdose weekly injection of the diabetes drug semaglutide caused a 15 weight loss and improved other heartrelated risk factors. Semaglutide works by mimicking a substance called GLP1, which is made naturally by the gut and the brain. It prods the pancreas to release insulin when blood sugar rises too high, reduces appetite, and makes people feel full following a meal. Studies show that people who regularly adhere to the Mediterranean diet lower their risk of cardiovascular disease, many types of cancer, and cognitive decline with age. But its possible that this healthy diet can be made even healthier. New research suggests that making the diet greener by boosting amounts of dark green vegetables, green tea, and plant proteins high in the micronutrients known as polyphenols offers even greater benefits. People should be cautious about weightloss diets that restrict a specific category of food such as carbohydrates, fats, or even animal products without focusing on the overall quality of the foods. Diets with lots of ultraprocessed foods or red meat may contribute to poor heart health. But people can lose weight on lessextreme versions of either lowcarb or lowfat diets, as long as they focus mostly on unprocessed or minimally processed foods. The rates of heart disease among men are predicted to rise significantly by 2060. The primary reason is Americas rising rates of obesity and type 2 diabetes. While controlling calorie intake and increasing activity are the two best strategies for weight loss, another effective method is hospitalbased weight management programs that offer a team of physicians, nutritionists, exercise physiologists, life coaches, and counselors who provide instruction, guidance, and support for weight management. The modernization of standard home medical devices has made monitoring health easier than ever. These gadgets include thermometers, scales, blood pressure monitors, and pulse oximeters. Gadget features that are especially helpful for older adults are easy operation and large, lighted readouts. Its important that some home medical devices, such as blood pressure monitors and pulse oximeters, have a seal of approval from an accredited agency, such as the FDA for pulse oximeters or the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation for blood pressure monitors. Most adults need seven to nine hours of sleep each night, but more than onethird consistently sleep fewer than seven. Reasons for poor sleep include pregnancy, menopausal night sweats, medication use, sleep disorders, and various illnesses. Sleep deprivation can raise the risks for such conditions as diabetes, certain cancers, obesity, dementia, depression, and heart disease. To promote sounder sleep, people can keep consistent sleepwake schedules, reduce intake of caffeine and alcohol, and avoid using electronic devices before bed. The bodys second largest organ, the liver is responsible for more than 500 bodily functions. One of the livers greatest threats is nonalcoholic fatty liver disease NAFLD, an umbrella term that includes several forms of liver disease. Most people with NAFLD have a type known as simple fatty liver. However, up to 20 of people with NAFLD develop inflammation in the liver known as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis NASH. Left unchecked, this more dangerous form can progress into fibrosis scarring and potentially cirrhosis severe scarring and liver damage. Lifestyle changes, such as weight loss, increasing exercise, and adopting a plantbased diet are the best means to manage and prevent NAFLD. Several drugs originally developed to treat type 2 diabetes can help people shed as much as 20 of their body weightfar more than other antiobesity drugs. Known as incretin mimetics, they also improve blood pressure and cholesterol levels.

Doctors concentrate on helping men lower their blood levels of lowdensity lipoprotein LDL, or bad cholesterol, to lower their risk of cardiovascular disease. Lower HDL levels are associated with higher cardiovascular risk. This may be related to HDLs role in helping to remove excess cholesterol in arteries that can lead to plaque buildup and increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes. However, no specific therapies to raise HDL levels have improved outcomes. A 2022 study found that eating later in the day increases hunger, decreases the number of calories a person burns, and promotes fat storage. Over time, those effects could lead to weight gain. People who use artificial sweeteners such as aspartame NutraSweet, Equal, acesulfame potassium Sunnett, Sweet One, and sucralose Splenda may have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease compared with people who avoid these products. These zerocalorie sweeteners might not help people lose weight, and experts postulate that artificial sweeteners may trigger inflammation and alter normal metabolism, the gut microbiome, and blood vessels in ways that promote type 2 diabetes, unhealthy cholesterol levels, and high blood pressure. Some doctors recommend eating meals earlier in the day to control weight, and some evidence backs that up. For example, a 2022 study found that eating later in the day increased hunger and fat storage, and decreased appetitereducing hormone levels and fat burning. To eat meals earlier in the day, one approach is eating either two large meals per day a large breakfast and a second large meal in midafternoon or at least having a third meal that ends by 5 p.m. Unhealthy lifestyle habits, chronic diseases, and genetic conditions can damage the kidneys and reduce their ability to do their many jobs. But many precautions can help protect the kidneys. Examples include controlling diabetes lowering high blood pressure moderating intake of salt, alcohol, and protein limiting intake of oxalaterich foods such as spinach, almonds, or cashews losing weight stopping smoking exercising regularly staying hydrated limiting the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs NSAIDs and getting annual kidney function tests. People with attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder, a condition marked by trouble focusing and impulsive behavior, may be more likely to have cardiovascular disease that people without the disorder. Weightloss surgery is now viewed as a way to both prevent and treat health problems linked to extreme obesity, such as diabetes, heart disease, and sleep apnea. Annually, more than 250,000 Americans undergo bariatric procedures, which can help extend their lives. Weightloss procedures include sleeve gastrectomy, gastric bypass, and gastric banding, which reduce stomach size and change the way the body absorbs food. The surgery adds to other weightloss measures such as diet, exercise, and medications. The American Heart Association recently revised its checklist for achieving optimal heart health. Adequate sleep was added, and updates were made to previous recommendations for diet, cholesterol and blood sugar measurements, and nicotine exposure. Hybrid exercise training combines heartpumping aerobic action with musclestrengthening moves in the same exercise session. The strategy has the advantage of meeting two key goals of the federal Physical Activity Guidelines in one fell swoop. And it also appears to be one of the bestand most timeefficientways for people who are overweight to lower their risk of cardiovascularrelated risk factors. Strong muscles boost a persons basal metabolic ratethe amount of energy the body needs to keep working during rest. That improves weightloss efforts by ramping up the number of calories burned. Too much or too little potassium can harm the heart. Diet, medications, and kidney function can affect the bodys potassium level. Dietary potassium helps keep blood pressure in a normal range, but most Americans dont consume enough of this mineral. However, people taking medications that raise potassium levelswhich includes certain drugs to treat high blood pressure and heart failureshould avoid salt substitutes made with potassium chloride.

But the ideal number for individuals depends on their individual goals and whether they also have a chronic condition, such as heart disease or kidney disease. Limiting meals to a certain window of time each day, an approach called timerestricted eating, didnt appear to help people lose any more weight compared with ordinary calorie restriction in a small randomized trial published in 2022. Misperceptions and biases about obesity can derail progress against this common disease, which affects 42 of Americans and is linked to many serious health problems, including heart disease. Bias and stigma against people with obesity is widespread, often due to a belief that poor choices and lack of motivation are the only causes. But a number of interconnected factors are involved, including an obesitypromoting environment, lack of physical activity, genetics, insufficient sleep, mental health issues, and certain medications. A new study suggests a highfiber diet may protect against dementia. In a group of about 3,700 older adults, those who consumed the most fiber about 20 grams daily had the lowest rates of dementia, and those who ate the least fiber 8 grams daily had the highest rates. Aging and a family history can increase the risk for a stroke, but women can lower it by managing factors that are under their controlsuch as diet, exercise, blood pressure, smoking, and diabetes. People who work the night shift might benefit from eating their meals during daytime hours. A 2021 study found a rise in blood sugar in people following night shift hours who ate some meals at night, but not in those who ate all meals during the day. A study published online Jan. 15, 2022, byAppetitesuggested that peoples expectations of how full they will feel after eating can influence their actual food intake. A 2021 study verified that intermittent fasting may be an effective weightloss strategy. It also seemed to improve some measures of risk for cardiovascular disease, such as lowering blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar. Flowers, chocolates, organ donation are you in?

Consuming more than a half tablespoon of olive oil per day may protect people from cardiovascular disease, cancer, and Alzheimers disease, according to a 2022 study. According to the CDC, about 42 of men ages 60 and older are obese. But fat in itself is not the issue, as the body needs a certain amount of fat to stay healthy. The amount of stored fat, and especially its location in the body, have the greatest impact on health. Consuming too many calories and not getting enough exercise both contribute to stored fat, but people can reduce their amounts by watching calorie intake and increasing exercise, in particular with resistance training for men. A study published Jan. 18, 2022, in theJournal of the American College of Cardiologyfound that people who consumed the most olive oil had a 19 lower risk of dying during a 28year study period, compared with those who rarely or never consumed olive oil. Using salt substitutes containing potassium chloride instead of using sodium chloride table salt may help reduce heart attack and stroke risk. A Harvard study published online Nov. 13, 2021, byThe New England Journal of Medicinefound that people who consumed the most sodium chloride had a 60 higher risk of a major cardiovascular event a heart attack, a stroke, cardiac stent placement, or surgery compared with those who consumed the least. People who consumed the most potassium chloride had a 31 lower risk of a major cardiovascular event compared with the people who consumed the least. Betweenmeal snacks can either help or hinder peoples efforts to eat a hearthealthy diet. Simple strategies such as upgrading food choices can help. Instead of lowquality carbs like candy or potato chips, people should choose highquality carbs like fruit or wholegrain crackers, along with a little protein or healthy fat such as half an apple with a handful of nuts. They should also try to avoid eating simply out of habit when theyre not actually hungry. Traditional Southern cuisine features side dishes based on vegetables, beans, and whole grains that, when served together, can make a complete, meatfree meal thats both filling and tasty. Its possible to overeat and not even realize it until youve finished a meal and doing so does not mean you have an eating problem or disorder. Mindfulness exercises can help you slow down and enjoy eating, making it easier to avoid overeating. Consuming less sodium and more potassium may be linked to better heart health, according to a November 2021 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. After controlling for other risk factors, the researchers found that for every extra 1,000 milligrams mg of sodium detected in the urine, there was an 18 increase in the risk of cardiovascular disease. For every extra 1,000 mg of potassium in the urine, there was an 18 decrease in risk. A 2021 study found that a lowcarb diet may not necessarily be bad for heart health, despite its high saturated fat content. However, the study period was short, and the diet used in the trial was healthier than many lowcarb approaches. More research is needed to confirm the results. In the meantime, experts recommend finding a sustainable diet that provides a healthy daily mix of nutritious foods instead of solely looking at carbohydrate content. People who follow a lowcarbohydratehighfat diet for weight loss often eat high amounts of saturated fat. Even though saturated fat can contribute to cardiovascular disease, a 2021 study suggests that eating higher amounts might not be bad for heart health in the short term.

Sleep hygiene Simple practices for better rest Should you be tested for inflammation? Exercising regularly every day if possible is the single most important thing you can do for your health. In the short term, exercise helps to control appetite, boost mood, and improve sleep. In the long term, it reduces the risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, dementia, depression, and many cancers. On this page youll discover Whether you were once much more physically active or have never been one to exercise regularly, now is a great time to start an exercise and fitness regimen. Getting and staying in shape is just as important for seniors as it is for younger people. Why is exercise important for older people? Getting your heart rate up and challenging your muscles benefits virtually every system in your body, and improves your physical and mental health in myriad ways. Physical activity helps maintain a healthy blood pressure, keeps harmful plaque from building up in your arteries, reduces inflammation, improves blood sugar levels, strengthens bones, and helps stave offdepression. In addition, a regular exercise program can make your sex life better, lead to better quality sleep, reduce your risk of some cancers, and is linked to longer life. Many older adults hesitate to get moving because theyre unfamiliar with thetypes of exerciseand fitness that are effective and safe, and arent sure how much exercise they need to do. The good news is that any kind of movement is better than being sedentary, so theres nothing wrong with starting small and working your way up to longer workouts. Your goal should be no less than 150 minutes of moderateintensity activity per week, but if you cant start at that level, work up to it and then past it. While there are many dedicated forms of exercise and fitness for adults, you also want to stay physically active throughout the day by taking the stairs, doing yard work, and playing with your grandkids. When it comes to exercise and fitness for seniors, most can begin without consulting a doctor but there are exceptions. If you have a major health condition likediabetes, high blood pressure, heart or lung disease,osteoprosis, or a neurological disease, definitely talk to your doctor first. People with mobility issues such as poor balance or arthritis should also get advice from their doctor. While there are endless forms ofexercise, experts categorize physical activity into four broad types based on what each calls upon your body to do and how the movement benefits you. Aerobic exercise is marked by an increased heart rate. Although most aerobic exercises require you to move your whole body, the main focus is on your heart and lungs aerobic exercise is often called cardio because it challenges and benefits your cardiovascular system. Activities like walking, swimming, dancing, and cycling, if done at sufficient intensity, get you breathing faster and your heart working harder. Aerobic exercises burn fat, improve your mood, reduce inflammation, and lower blood sugar. Strength training, sometimes called resistance training, should be performed two to three times a week. Squats, lunges, pushups, and the exercises performed on resistance machines or using weights or bands help maintain and even build muscle mass and strength. Strength training also helps prevent falls, keep bones strong, lower blood sugar levels, and improve balance. Do a combination of both isometric and isotonic exercises. Isometric exercises, such as doing planks and holding leg lifts, are done without movement. They are great for maintaining strength and improving stability. Isotonic exercises require you to bear weight throughout a range of motion. Bicep curls, bench presses, and situps are all forms of isotonic exercise. Stretching exerciseskeep your muscles and tendons flexible, preserve your posture, and improve mobility, especially as you age. Stretching can be done every day. Balance exercises call on the various systems that help you stay upright and oriented, such as those of the inner ear, vision, and muscles and joints. Tai chi and yoga are great forms of balance exercises that can help you avoid falls and stay independent well into your senior years. How much exercise you should be getting depends on several factors, including your current level of fitness, your fitness goals, the types of exercise youre planning to do, and whether you have deficits in such areas as strength, flexibility, or balance. As a general rule, 150 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise is recommended as a weekly minimum. As you become more fit, youll want to exceed that in order to reap maximum benefit. A natural way of splitting up the 150 minutes might be to do a 30minute session five times per week, or you can break it up and do two 15minute sessions during a single day. Adopt whatever schedule fits your lifestyle. For strength exercises, aim to work all your major muscle groups twice to three times each week, leaving 48 hours between each workout for recovery. If you do totalbody workouts, thats two sessions per week. If you choose to split your workouts to target a specific muscle group for example, leg day , that will require more frequent workouts. Just make sure youre leaving 48 hours of rest before you rework a major muscle. If you have noticed problems with your balance such as unsteadiness, dizziness, or vertigo, talk to a health care provider for recommendations about balancespecific exercises. Get in three halfhour workouts each week in addition to a 30minute walk at least twice weekly. Its best to stretch after you have warmed up for a few minutes, or perform stretching exercises after you completed your workout. When stretching each muscle group, take it slow and steady, release, repeat again. But how much exercise is too much? You should expect a little muscle soreness after workouts, especially in the beginning. But if you find that your body is simply not recovering between workouts, you may be overtraining. Remember that seniors need more recovery time than younger people. With the exception of welcome muscle soreness, an exercise program should make you feel good. If it doesnt, youre probably overdoing it. That doesnt mean you should quit, only that you should dial back the intensity or frequency of your workouts until you hit the sweet spot in which youve tired out your body but then recovered enough to tackle your next session with enthusiasm. A smartly designed exercise program will benefit your body and mind in innumerable ways. The benefits of exercise on mental health are well documented. For example, one major study found that sedentary people are 44 more likely to be depressed. Another found that those with mild to moderate depression could get similar results to those obtained through antidepressants just by exercising for 90 minutes each week. The key appears to be the release of brain chemicals such as serotonin and dopamine, which help lift mood and combat stress. Were all familiar with exercises ability to improve cardiovascular health. But how does exercise lower blood pressure? Interestingly, when you stimulate your circulatory system through aerobic exercise, youre temporarily increasing your blood pressure by forcing the system to work harder, but when youve finished exercising, your blood pressure drops to a lower level than it was before you began. Many people think of exercise as an integral part of weight loss, and although diet is also extremely important, theyre not wrong. But what exercise burns the most calories? Generally, aerobic exercises cardio are great for expending calories and reducing fat. But dont overlook the effectiveness of strength training, which optimizes your bodys ratio of lean muscle to fat Its also the best exercise for bone strength. Theres no Holy Grail when it comes to a single best weightloss exercise. The best exercise to lose weight is the one youll do consistently. Whatever gets your heart rate up and gets your body moving while having fun and staying motivated is the exercise that will help you shed pounds. Everyone can and should do some form of exercise, even if they face severe limitations. Experts have designed specific exercises for seniors that are lowimpact, safe, and able to be done even from a sitting position if necessary. If youre concerned about fall risk, balance exercises for seniors can be done holding onto a chair or door frame. For example, standing behind a chair, you can hold its back and lift one leg to about the height of the middle of the calf of the other leg while tightening your abdominal muscles. As you progress, you might try holding the chair with just one hand, and eventually letting go of the chair. Evencorestrengthening exercisesfor seniors can be adapted to those with limited abilities. For example, a standard plank is done by holding yourself parallel to the floor with only your forearms and toes touching the mat. An easier version allows you to also place your knees on the mat. But a still easier method is to do the plank while standing and leaning forward. You put your elbows and forearms on a desk, table, or wall while resting on the balls of your feet and keeping your back straight. There are a variety of stretching exercises for seniors to suit people of different abilities. Ifholding poses on your handsand knees is out of the question, you could try a fullbody stretch in which you lie on your back, straighten your legs, and extend your hands along the floor past your head. Some stretches can be done while seated, such as overhead stretches and neck rotations. In fact, other types of exercise also can be done from a seated position. Other chair exercises for seniors include bicep curls with dumbbells or elastic bands, overhead dumbbell presses, shoulder blade squeezes, calf raises, sittostands chair squats, and knee extensions. The best exercise program will incorporate both aerobic and strength training, since thats the best way to strengthen your entire body, improve your endurance, and ensure your longterm health. But if your main concern is how to improvecardiovascular health, then you should put a premium on cardiovascular exercises that force your heart and lungs to work harder, sending oxygen to your cells. While strength training certainly does have cardiovascular benefits, cardio workouts excel when it comes to reducing blood pressure, maintaining the health of the inner walls of your arteries, releasing enzymes that break down blood clots, and even promoting the growth of new arteries feeding the heart. Regular aerobic exercise also significantly lowers the risk of type 2 diabetes. Although diabetes usually isnt thought of as a heart problem, a lower risk of diabetes also lowers the risk of heart disease, since high blood sugar takes a toll on blood vessels and the nerves that control the heart. When you exercise, you call on your bodys cells to take glucose sugar out of the blood, which they do by becoming more sensitive to insulin, the hormone crucial to glucose metabolism. That means your cells remain insulinsensitive long after youre finished exercising. And since obesity is a significant risk for diabetes, exercises that help you shed fat especially around your middle will help you keep diabetes at bay.

The best exercise program will incorporate both aerobic and strength training, since thats the best way to strengthen your entire body, improve your endurance, and ensure your longterm health. But if your main concern is how to improvecardiovascular health, then you should put a premium on cardiovascular exercises that force your heart and lungs to work harder, sending oxygen to your cells. While strength training certainly does have cardiovascular benefits, cardio workouts excel when it comes to reducing blood pressure, maintaining the health of the inner walls of your arteries, releasing enzymes that break down blood clots, and even promoting the growth of new arteries feeding the heart. Regular aerobic exercise also significantly lowers the risk of type 2 diabetes. Although diabetes usually isnt thought of as a heart problem, a lower risk of diabetes also lowers the risk of heart disease, since high blood sugar takes a toll on blood vessels and the nerves that control the heart. When you exercise, you call on your bodys cells to take glucose sugar out of the blood, which they do by becoming more sensitive to insulin, the hormone crucial to glucose metabolism. That means your cells remain insulinsensitive long after youre finished exercising. And since obesity is a significant risk for diabetes, exercises that help you shed fat especially around your middle will help you keep diabetes at bay.

Sleep hygiene Simple practices for better rest Should you be tested for inflammation? Exercising regularly every day if possible is the single most important thing you can do for your health. In the short term, exercise helps to control appetite, boost mood, and improve sleep. In the long term, it reduces the risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, dementia, depression, and many cancers. On this page youll discover Whether you were once much more physically active or have never been one to exercise regularly, now is a great time to start an exercise and fitness regimen. Getting and staying in shape is just as important for seniors as it is for younger people. Why is exercise important for older people? Getting your heart rate up and challenging your muscles benefits virtually every system in your body, and improves your physical and mental health in myriad ways. Physical activity helps maintain a healthy blood pressure, keeps harmful plaque from building up in your arteries, reduces inflammation, improves blood sugar levels, strengthens bones, and helps stave offdepression. In addition, a regular exercise program can make your sex life better, lead to better quality sleep, reduce your risk of some cancers, and is linked to longer life. Many older adults hesitate to get moving because theyre unfamiliar with thetypes of exerciseand fitness that are effective and safe, and arent sure how much exercise they need to do. The good news is that any kind of movement is better than being sedentary, so theres nothing wrong with starting small and working your way up to longer workouts. Your goal should be no less than 150 minutes of moderateintensity activity per week, but if you cant start at that level, work up to it and then past it. While there are many dedicated forms of exercise and fitness for adults, you also want to stay physically active throughout the day by taking the stairs, doing yard work, and playing with your grandkids. When it comes to exercise and fitness for seniors, most can begin without consulting a doctor but there are exceptions. If you have a major health condition likediabetes, high blood pressure, heart or lung disease,osteoprosis, or a neurological disease, definitely talk to your doctor first. People with mobility issues such as poor balance or arthritis should also get advice from their doctor. While there are endless forms ofexercise, experts categorize physical activity into four broad types based on what each calls upon your body to do and how the movement benefits you. Aerobic exercise is marked by an increased heart rate. Although most aerobic exercises require you to move your whole body, the main focus is on your heart and lungs aerobic exercise is often called cardio because it challenges and benefits your cardiovascular system. Activities like walking, swimming, dancing, and cycling, if done at sufficient intensity, get you breathing faster and your heart working harder. Aerobic exercises burn fat, improve your mood, reduce inflammation, and lower blood sugar. Strength training, sometimes called resistance training, should be performed two to three times a week. Squats, lunges, pushups, and the exercises performed on resistance machines or using weights or bands help maintain and even build muscle mass and strength. Strength training also helps prevent falls, keep bones strong, lower blood sugar levels, and improve balance. Do a combination of both isometric and isotonic exercises. Isometric exercises, such as doing planks and holding leg lifts, are done without movement. They are great for maintaining strength and improving stability. Isotonic exercises require you to bear weight throughout a range of motion. Bicep curls, bench presses, and situps are all forms of isotonic exercise. Stretching exerciseskeep your muscles and tendons flexible, preserve your posture, and improve mobility, especially as you age. Stretching can be done every day. Balance exercises call on the various systems that help you stay upright and oriented, such as those of the inner ear, vision, and muscles and joints. Tai chi and yoga are great forms of balance exercises that can help you avoid falls and stay independent well into your senior years. How much exercise you should be getting depends on several factors, including your current level of fitness, your fitness goals, the types of exercise youre planning to do, and whether you have deficits in such areas as strength, flexibility, or balance. As a general rule, 150 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise is recommended as a weekly minimum. As you become more fit, youll want to exceed that in order to reap maximum benefit. A natural way of splitting up the 150 minutes might be to do a 30minute session five times per week, or you can break it up and do two 15minute sessions during a single day. Adopt whatever schedule fits your lifestyle. For strength exercises, aim to work all your major muscle groups twice to three times each week, leaving 48 hours between each workout for recovery. If you do totalbody workouts, thats two sessions per week. If you choose to split your workouts to target a specific muscle group for example, leg day , that will require more frequent workouts. Just make sure youre leaving 48 hours of rest before you rework a major muscle. If you have noticed problems with your balance such as unsteadiness, dizziness, or vertigo, talk to a health care provider for recommendations about balancespecific exercises. Get in three halfhour workouts each week in addition to a 30minute walk at least twice weekly. Its best to stretch after you have warmed up for a few minutes, or perform stretching exercises after you completed your workout. When stretching each muscle group, take it slow and steady, release, repeat again. But how much exercise is too much? You should expect a little muscle soreness after workouts, especially in the beginning. But if you find that your body is simply not recovering between workouts, you may be overtraining. Remember that seniors need more recovery time than younger people. With the exception of welcome muscle soreness, an exercise program should make you feel good. If it doesnt, youre probably overdoing it. That doesnt mean you should quit, only that you should dial back the intensity or frequency of your workouts until you hit the sweet spot in which youve tired out your body but then recovered enough to tackle your next session with enthusiasm. A smartly designed exercise program will benefit your body and mind in innumerable ways. The benefits of exercise on mental health are well documented. For example, one major study found that sedentary people are 44 more likely to be depressed. Another found that those with mild to moderate depression could get similar results to those obtained through antidepressants just by exercising for 90 minutes each week. The key appears to be the release of brain chemicals such as serotonin and dopamine, which help lift mood and combat stress. Were all familiar with exercises ability to improve cardiovascular health. But how does exercise lower blood pressure? Interestingly, when you stimulate your circulatory system through aerobic exercise, youre temporarily increasing your blood pressure by forcing the system to work harder, but when youve finished exercising, your blood pressure drops to a lower level than it was before you began. Many people think of exercise as an integral part of weight loss, and although diet is also extremely important, theyre not wrong. But what exercise burns the most calories? Generally, aerobic exercises cardio are great for expending calories and reducing fat. But dont overlook the effectiveness of strength training, which optimizes your bodys ratio of lean muscle to fat Its also the best exercise for bone strength. Theres no Holy Grail when it comes to a single best weightloss exercise. The best exercise to lose weight is the one youll do consistently. Whatever gets your heart rate up and gets your body moving while having fun and staying motivated is the exercise that will help you shed pounds. Everyone can and should do some form of exercise, even if they face severe limitations. Experts have designed specific exercises for seniors that are lowimpact, safe, and able to be done even from a sitting position if necessary. If youre concerned about fall risk, balance exercises for seniors can be done holding onto a chair or door frame. For example, standing behind a chair, you can hold its back and lift one leg to about the height of the middle of the calf of the other leg while tightening your abdominal muscles. As you progress, you might try holding the chair with just one hand, and eventually letting go of the chair. Evencorestrengthening exercisesfor seniors can be adapted to those with limited abilities. For example, a standard plank is done by holding yourself parallel to the floor with only your forearms and toes touching the mat. An easier version allows you to also place your knees on the mat. But a still easier method is to do the plank while standing and leaning forward. You put your elbows and forearms on a desk, table, or wall while resting on the balls of your feet and keeping your back straight. There are a variety of stretching exercises for seniors to suit people of different abilities. Ifholding poses on your handsand knees is out of the question, you could try a fullbody stretch in which you lie on your back, straighten your legs, and extend your hands along the floor past your head. Some stretches can be done while seated, such as overhead stretches and neck rotations. In fact, other types of exercise also can be done from a seated position. Other chair exercises for seniors include bicep curls with dumbbells or elastic bands, overhead dumbbell presses, shoulder blade squeezes, calf raises, sittostands chair squats, and knee extensions.

Although diabetes usually isnt thought of as a heart problem, a lower risk of diabetes also lowers the risk of heart disease, since high blood sugar takes a toll on blood vessels and the nerves that control the heart. When you exercise, you call on your bodys cells to take glucose sugar out of the blood, which they do by becoming more sensitive to insulin, the hormone crucial to glucose metabolism. That means your cells remain insulinsensitive long after youre finished exercising. And since obesity is a significant risk for diabetes, exercises that help you shed fat especially around your middle will help you keep diabetes at bay.

Sleep hygiene Simple practices for better rest Should you be tested for inflammation? Exercising regularly every day if possible is the single most important thing you can do for your health. In the short term, exercise helps to control appetite, boost mood, and improve sleep. In the long term, it reduces the risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, dementia, depression, and many cancers. On this page youll discover Whether you were once much more physically active or have never been one to exercise regularly, now is a great time to start an exercise and fitness regimen. Getting and staying in shape is just as important for seniors as it is for younger people. Why is exercise important for older people? Getting your heart rate up and challenging your muscles benefits virtually every system in your body, and improves your physical and mental health in myriad ways. Physical activity helps maintain a healthy blood pressure, keeps harmful plaque from building up in your arteries, reduces inflammation, improves blood sugar levels, strengthens bones, and helps stave offdepression. In addition, a regular exercise program can make your sex life better, lead to better quality sleep, reduce your risk of some cancers, and is linked to longer life. Many older adults hesitate to get moving because theyre unfamiliar with thetypes of exerciseand fitness that are effective and safe, and arent sure how much exercise they need to do. The good news is that any kind of movement is better than being sedentary, so theres nothing wrong with starting small and working your way up to longer workouts. Your goal should be no less than 150 minutes of moderateintensity activity per week, but if you cant start at that level, work up to it and then past it. While there are many dedicated forms of exercise and fitness for adults, you also want to stay physically active throughout the day by taking the stairs, doing yard work, and playing with your grandkids. When it comes to exercise and fitness for seniors, most can begin without consulting a doctor but there are exceptions. If you have a major health condition likediabetes, high blood pressure, heart or lung disease,osteoprosis, or a neurological disease, definitely talk to your doctor first. People with mobility issues such as poor balance or arthritis should also get advice from their doctor. While there are endless forms ofexercise, experts categorize physical activity into four broad types based on what each calls upon your body to do and how the movement benefits you. Aerobic exercise is marked by an increased heart rate. Although most aerobic exercises require you to move your whole body, the main focus is on your heart and lungs aerobic exercise is often called cardio because it challenges and benefits your cardiovascular system. Activities like walking, swimming, dancing, and cycling, if done at sufficient intensity, get you breathing faster and your heart working harder. Aerobic exercises burn fat, improve your mood, reduce inflammation, and lower blood sugar. Strength training, sometimes called resistance training, should be performed two to three times a week. Squats, lunges, pushups, and the exercises performed on resistance machines or using weights or bands help maintain and even build muscle mass and strength. Strength training also helps prevent falls, keep bones strong, lower blood sugar levels, and improve balance. Do a combination of both isometric and isotonic exercises. Isometric exercises, such as doing planks and holding leg lifts, are done without movement. They are great for maintaining strength and improving stability. Isotonic exercises require you to bear weight throughout a range of motion. Bicep curls, bench presses, and situps are all forms of isotonic exercise. Stretching exerciseskeep your muscles and tendons flexible, preserve your posture, and improve mobility, especially as you age. Stretching can be done every day. Balance exercises call on the various systems that help you stay upright and oriented, such as those of the inner ear, vision, and muscles and joints. Tai chi and yoga are great forms of balance exercises that can help you avoid falls and stay independent well into your senior years. How much exercise you should be getting depends on several factors, including your current level of fitness, your fitness goals, the types of exercise youre planning to do, and whether you have deficits in such areas as strength, flexibility, or balance. As a general rule, 150 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise is recommended as a weekly minimum. As you become more fit, youll want to exceed that in order to reap maximum benefit. A natural way of splitting up the 150 minutes might be to do a 30minute session five times per week, or you can break it up and do two 15minute sessions during a single day. Adopt whatever schedule fits your lifestyle. For strength exercises, aim to work all your major muscle groups twice to three times each week, leaving 48 hours between each workout for recovery. If you do totalbody workouts, thats two sessions per week. If you choose to split your workouts to target a specific muscle group for example, leg day , that will require more frequent workouts. Just make sure youre leaving 48 hours of rest before you rework a major muscle. If you have noticed problems with your balance such as unsteadiness, dizziness, or vertigo, talk to a health care provider for recommendations about balancespecific exercises. Get in three halfhour workouts each week in addition to a 30minute walk at least twice weekly. Its best to stretch after you have warmed up for a few minutes, or perform stretching exercises after you completed your workout. When stretching each muscle group, take it slow and steady, release, repeat again. But how much exercise is too much? You should expect a little muscle soreness after workouts, especially in the beginning. But if you find that your body is simply not recovering between workouts, you may be overtraining. Remember that seniors need more recovery time than younger people. With the exception of welcome muscle soreness, an exercise program should make you feel good. If it doesnt, youre probably overdoing it. That doesnt mean you should quit, only that you should dial back the intensity or frequency of your workouts until you hit the sweet spot in which youve tired out your body but then recovered enough to tackle your next session with enthusiasm. A smartly designed exercise program will benefit your body and mind in innumerable ways. The benefits of exercise on mental health are well documented. For example, one major study found that sedentary people are 44 more likely to be depressed. Another found that those with mild to moderate depression could get similar results to those obtained through antidepressants just by exercising for 90 minutes each week. The key appears to be the release of brain chemicals such as serotonin and dopamine, which help lift mood and combat stress. Were all familiar with exercises ability to improve cardiovascular health. But how does exercise lower blood pressure? Interestingly, when you stimulate your circulatory system through aerobic exercise, youre temporarily increasing your blood pressure by forcing the system to work harder, but when youve finished exercising, your blood pressure drops to a lower level than it was before you began. Many people think of exercise as an integral part of weight loss, and although diet is also extremely important, theyre not wrong. But what exercise burns the most calories? Generally, aerobic exercises cardio are great for expending calories and reducing fat. But dont overlook the effectiveness of strength training, which optimizes your bodys ratio of lean muscle to fat Its also the best exercise for bone strength. Theres no Holy Grail when it comes to a single best weightloss exercise. The best exercise to lose weight is the one youll do consistently. Whatever gets your heart rate up and gets your body moving while having fun and staying motivated is the exercise that will help you shed pounds. Everyone can and should do some form of exercise, even if they face severe limitations. Experts have designed specific exercises for seniors that are lowimpact, safe, and able to be done even from a sitting position if necessary. If youre concerned about fall risk, balance exercises for seniors can be done holding onto a chair or door frame. For example, standing behind a chair, you can hold its back and lift one leg to about the height of the middle of the calf of the other leg while tightening your abdominal muscles. As you progress, you might try holding the chair with just one hand, and eventually letting go of the chair. Evencorestrengthening exercisesfor seniors can be adapted to those with limited abilities. For example, a standard plank is done by holding yourself parallel to the floor with only your forearms and toes touching the mat. An easier version allows you to also place your knees on the mat. But a still easier method is to do the plank while standing and leaning forward. You put your elbows and forearms on a desk, table, or wall while resting on the balls of your feet and keeping your back straight. There are a variety of stretching exercises for seniors to suit people of different abilities. Ifholding poses on your handsand knees is out of the question, you could try a fullbody stretch in which you lie on your back, straighten your legs, and extend your hands along the floor past your head. Some stretches can be done while seated, such as overhead stretches and neck rotations. In fact, other types of exercise also can be done from a seated position. Other chair exercises for seniors include bicep curls with dumbbells or elastic bands, overhead dumbbell presses, shoulder blade squeezes, calf raises, sittostands chair squats, and knee extensions. The best exercise program will incorporate both aerobic and strength training, since thats the best way to strengthen your entire body, improve your endurance, and ensure your longterm health. But if your main concern is how to improvecardiovascular health, then you should put a premium on cardiovascular exercises that force your heart and lungs to work harder, sending oxygen to your cells. While strength training certainly does have cardiovascular benefits, cardio workouts excel when it comes to reducing blood pressure, maintaining the health of the inner walls of your arteries, releasing enzymes that break down blood clots, and even promoting the growth of new arteries feeding the heart.

Scientists have studied highintensity bursts of exercise a great deal in recent years, but research continues to also focus on the health benefits of moderateintensity, continuous movement. Studies suggest both types of exercise can lower the odds of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and premature death. Highintensity exercise, however, can help people fulfill recommended exercise guidelines in less time. It does pose drawbacks, however, such as a higher risk of injuries and inflammation to joints and muscles. Exercising outdoors in winter can offer different health benefits from summer. Cold weather may improve endurance, and the lower temperatures may help transform some white fat, including belly fat, into calorieburning brown fat. Winter is also an opportunity to take up seasonal sports and activities like fat biking, crosscountry skiing, and running or hiking new trails. For safety, exercisers should bundle up, protect their extremities, use sunscreen, and drink enough water. A 2024 Harvard study of 90,000 people average age 62, followed for about 10 years, found that getting 150 minutes per week of moderatetovigorous physical activity was tied to improved health, particularly heart health. But among people who got the recommended amount of exercise, those who were the most sedentary the rest of the time had a greater risk of developing heart failure and dying from heart disease, compared with those who were the least sedentary. A 2024 study of more than 10,000 dementiafree people found that fitting the recommended amount of weekly exercise into one or two sessions was associated with a similar reduction in dementia risk as exercising throughout the work week. Research has shown that feelings of general anxiety, nervousness, and fear tend to rise with age. This can lead to increased isolation and less exercise, and may progress to an anxiety disorder. Strategies to help manage and overcome increased feelings of fear include seeing a therapist, practicing mindfulness, consulting with a financial expert, and hiring a personal trainer.

The key is strengthening and stretching the upper back, chest, and core muscles. Shoulder strengtheners include scapula squeezes and rows. Core strengtheners include modified planks or simply tightening the abdominal muscles, pulling the navel in toward the spine. Its also important to cut down on activities that have led to poor posture, such as sitting slouched for long periods in front of a computer or TV. Having a home workout area can make it easier to meet daily exercise goals, especially during the winter months, when weather conditions may make outdoor exercise impractical. If space allows, people may want a treadmill or other machine thats suitable for any health issues they may have. For example, people with hip or knee arthritis often find that a stationary bike is more comfortable for arthritic joints. For strength training, resistance bands or tubes are ideal for beginners because theyre affordable, versatile, and easy to use. Scheduling a few sessions with either a physical therapist or certified personal trainer can help people learn and practice proper form. Many people dont bother with regular stretching, but it takes little time and offers big benefits. Stretching can help reduce the risk of injuries, improve mobility to protect against falls, and increase flexibility, which studies have linked with greater longevity. The key to stretching is consistency and committing to an ongoing routine. People should do two types of stretching dynamic for warming up muscles and joints, and static for recovery after being active. A 2024 study indicates that concentrated, weekend warrior exercise is just as effective at protecting against many health conditions as spreading exercise throughout the week. Men may avoid or grudgingly perform certain exercises because they can be difficult or too challenging. For many, these are exercises that offer numerous benefits, such as squats, pushups, and bridges, but that also highlight areas of muscle weakness and tightness. However, by modifying these exercises to match their limitations and adjusting their expectations, men can learn to enjoy them. Cold weather can lead to stiff, sore muscles. To avoid that, it helps to perform two types of stretches. One type is called dynamic stretching. It involves flowing, repetitive motions that prepare muscles for activity by getting blood, oxygen, and heat to them. The other type is called static stretching. It involves holding a certain position for 20 to 30 seconds, which gently lengthens the muscles to keep them flexible. Static stretching should be performed only after the muscles are warmed up.

Many yard and gardening tasksincluding raking and mowing require enough effort to count as moderateintensity exercise. Chores like digging and bagging leaves also help strengthen muscles. A 2023 study found that gardening helps increase physical activity levels, encourages greater fiber intake, and lowers stress and anxietyall of which reduce the risk of heart disease. A recent study found that engaging inhighintensity interval training may be better for brain health than other less vigorous routines. In a 2024 randomized controlled trial, older adults average age 71 who took part in an intensive weight training program three times per week for one year had better leg strength four years later than people who had taken part in more moderate strength training. As children go through another school year under the cloud of the COVID19 pandemic, parents are asking what they can do to keep their children healthy. While no magic solutions can ward off every illness, parents can take steps to help children and everyone in their household protect their health by keeping their immune systems robust. If its hard to fit balance training into a busy schedule, it might be easier to just do a oneminute balance exercise at different points in the day. Those points might occur during TV watching, cooking, or toothbrushing. Ideas for simple balance exercises include standing on one leg, heel raises, or sittostandsgoing from a sitting to a standing position, arms crossed, then returning to a sitting position and repeating the process. Its best to stand near a counter or chair for support. Most of us dont think twice about standing up, but for people affected by postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome POTS, standing can provoke lightheadedness and a racing heartbeat. While some people with POTS will require medications, most will improve with some specific dietary and behavioral changes. A gentle form of soccer called walking soccer is packed with health benefits. Its a great way to socialize, exercise, and keep knee cartilage healthy. Playing the game also helps reinforce a persons ability to maintain balance and the ability to produce physical power, such as the force needed to get out of a chair and stand up. However, the game does pose some physical risks, such as ankle sprains, flareups of knee arthritis, and falls that result in wrist, arm, or elbow fractures. The most common causes of hand pain include osteoarthritis, nerve conditions, and tendinitis. To help manage the pain and avoid surgery, doctors recommend splinting, corticosteroid injections, antiinflammatories, heat and cold applications, and hand exer Flowers, chocolates, organ donation are you in?

The original Presidential Physical Fitness Test consisted of five exercises a onemile run, pullups or pushups, situps, shuttle run, and sitandreach. The test gauged upperbody and core strength, endurance, flexibility, and agility for Americas youth. Still, with some modifications, older adults can use the test to assess a baseline of their fitness and identify areas where they need to improve. A 2024 study found that offering reminders or incentives seems to motivate people to walk more than they normally do. And people who are offered incentives such as money or game points walk more than people who receive only daily reminders to walk. A 2024 study found that people who exercise regularly are much less likely to get COVID19 or be hospitalized with it, compared with people who dont exercise regularly. Thats because exercise keeps the immune system strong and able to fight off infection. Exercise enhances the ability of white blood cells to do battle stimulates the production of antibodies in the lining of the nose, throat, breathing tubes, and lungs and keeps the immune system from overreacting to infections and harming the body.

But before you head out on the water, youll want to get some key muscle groups in shape, especially ones that probably have not been used much during winter. Practicing the deep low squat, commonly known as the Asian squat, can improve lower back strength, flexibility, and mobility at the hips, knees, and ankles. Kettlebells can add depth to home workouts as they are easily stored and can be used to perform virtually any type of movement for an allaround workout that hits the major muscles. Kettlebells look like balls or bells with handles on top and range in weight from five to 30 pounds and higher. While they can function similarly to dumbbells, kettlebells can provide a more challenging workout, as a person needs muscle strength, balance, core stability, flexibility, and coordination to control its weight. In a 2024 study, people who exercised at least twice a week for a total of at least an hour, for 10 years were less likely to report difficulty falling asleep or sleeping for less than six hours a night compared with people who were inactive for 10 years. Riding an electric bicycle ebike has risks and benefits. On the plus side, an ebikewhich has a builtin electric motorcan assist a rider when pedaling is difficult. It puts less compression on the joints than a conventional bike, and makes riding easier for people with joint pain or diminished strength or endurance. But at higher speeds, an ebike can be difficult to control for people not used to riding, which might lead to accidents. Highintensity interval training HIIT is a timeefficient way for people to improve their fitness and cardiovascular health. Even short bursts of highintensity activity may trigger the release of moodboosting brain chemicals. Traditionally, HIIT features 30 to 90 seconds of highintensity effort followed by an equal or longer period of lowerintensity activity or rest. HIIT variations includefartlekSwedish for speed play , which uses environmental cues to set intervals, and Tabata, which features 20second intervals of intensity followed by 10second recovery intervals. The loss of muscle mass begins in ones 30s and accelerates after age 60. A loss of upperbody strength can make it more difficult to complete daily activities, and it may also increase the risk for muscle injury during an activity that involves reaching. A physical therapy program can help increase muscle mass in older age. Such a program typically involves gentle stretching to keep muscles supple, plus strengthening exercises like triceps curls, with low amounts of weight just a few pounds and a high number of repetitions. Legs are the foundation for many enjoyable activitiesrunning, bicycling, swimming, and more. Building strong leg muscles can improve your performance, build endurance, and reduce your risk of injury. These exercises will work all of the major muscle groups in your legs. Flowers, chocolates, organ donation are you in?

They also help people who have trouble gripping or holding dumbbells or need greater control when exercising, like when recovering from an injury or managing joint pain. A 2024 study found that among people at risk for high blood pressure, those who practiced tai chi for one hour four times a week for a year experienced an average sevenpoint drop in blood pressure, compared with a fourpoint drop in those who did aerobics instead. Spinning classes offer a great cardiovascular workout for older men and can help build lowerbody muscle strength. Spinning is also a lowimpact exercise that places less stress on the joints, which makes it ideal for men with knee or hip issues or those recovering from orthopedic injuries. Nordic walking is a popular way to enjoy the benefits of walking while getting a fullbody workout. It mimics the motion of crosscountry skiing by using poles to push yourself as you walk along and can offer a higherintensity workout than walking. About 38 million Americans practice yoga, and threequarters are women. Some people hesitate to try yoga because they wrongly believe they must be slender and flexible and need to buy costly equipment. But yogas health benefits are plentiful and proven. Research suggests yoga eases depression, boosts sleep quality, improves chronic pain, and reduces cardiovascular disease risks. People can overcome their reluctance to try yoga by joining a class, taking a friend along, asking for modifications, and being patient with their progress. Implantable blood sugar monitoring devices known as CGMs have revolutionized care for millions of people with diabetes. Now several companies are marketing them for peoplewithoutdiabetes to monitor blood sugar levels but is there any evidence for health benefits? Stretching keeps the muscles flexible, strong, and healthy, which is needed to maintain a range of motion in the joints. If possible one should stretch daily, focusing on the lower extremities. Its important to stretch after a workout, not before. Concussion is one of the most common injuries to the brain, affecting about two million children and teens every year. Understanding signs, symptoms, questions to ask, and how concussion care has changed in recent years can make a difference in identifying concussion and recovery.

A 2024 study suggests doing a workout thats a combination of aerobics and strength training might reduce cardiovascular risk factors just as effectively as a workout that consists of aerobics only. A 2023 study found that people with chronic conditions who took part in highintensity interval training in the watercalled aquatic HIIT or AHIITexperienced a similar boost in endurance their maximum sustained physical exertion as people who took part in landbased HIIT. An AHIIT workout includes a warmup, such as treading water, followed by intervals of rest and intense activity such as swimming laps or doing four or five pool exercises in a row, as quickly as possible, for a total of 30 minutes. If youve been cocooning due to winters cold, who can blame you? But lack of activity isnt good for body or mind during any season. Any day is a good day to start exercising, but if you arent sure how to start, or if you have an obstacle to overcome, read on. Common activity guidelines recommend a minimum of 150 minutes of moderateintensity physical activity and two musclestrengthening workouts per week. However, these targets are meant for a broad population, and for many older adults, hitting just the 150 minutes per week poses a challenge. Experts suggest breaking down the 150 minutes into manageable segments, like doing 30 minutes of activity five days a week, and even dividing those 30 minutes into 10 minutes of exercise three times a day. A 2023 study found that people who engaged in moderate or vigorous exercise an average of four days a week had more brain mass in regions associated with cognitive skills like memory and learning, compared with people who did not exercise. Fatigue is a common symptom that can be caused by a whole host of factors, from medical conditions to stress and poor sleep. In order to ease ongoing fatigue, its important to investigate and treat the underlying cause. Fatigue that doesnt respond to interventions or is severe or persistent should be brought to the attention of a doctor. It may be caused by a medical condition. Using your own body weight for exercise is simple and straightforward, but sometimes you need to further challenge your muscles. Resistance bands are versatile, portable, and easy to use to strengthen legs. These four leg exercises with resistance bands will enhance your lowerbody workouts. Resistance bands dont look impressive, but they work muscles in different ways than other pieces of strengthbuilding equipment. The bands offer varying levels of resistance, can be used to strengthen a variety of muscle groups, and may be easier to use for some people. Chest exercises can help you achieve a strong, sculpted physique. But building the chest muscles offers a myriad of benefits beyond looking toned. Flowers, chocolates, organ donation are you in?

Monitoring your breathing is a good way to ensure you work out at an intensity that is sufficient and not too high. Personal trainers can provide a range of benefits, including developing a personalized, balanced workout. People focused on heart health often prioritize exercise that raises their heart rate cardio or aerobic exercise. But strength training builds lean muscle mass, which helps burn body fat, keeps blood sugar in check, and may help reduce cholesterol levels. Trainers also teach people how to exercise safely to avoid injuries which is especially helpful when using free weights and also provide motivation to foster a positive mindset. Jumping rope is an ideal plyometric exercise that helps improve coordination, agility, and flexibility and offers an excellent heartpumping workout. Flowers, chocolates, organ donation are you in?

But is this type of motivation helpful? A recent study looked deeper into the trend. It takes more than a weekly session with a personal trainer to maximize exercise benefits. Personal trainers recommend that people exercise in between training sessions do strength training at the beginning of a workout alternate the muscle groups that get a workout challenge each muscle group with a variety of exercises stretch regularly eat a healthy diet to fuel the body and exercise purposefully, with a strategic approach that moves them closer to their exercise goals. In a 2023 study, people who did bouts of daily activities, such as taking stairs, mopping the floor, and gardening, that lasted from one to 10 minutes had a lower risk for heart attacks and strokes compared with those who were active for less than a minute. A 2023 study found that people who exercise in the morning, specifically between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., have a lower risk of obesity than those who are most active in the midday or evening. When a shoulder workout seems timeconsuming or challenging, it might help to make the exercises easier or more appealing. One approach is doing shoulder exercises with a resistance band instead of fancy weight machines. Another strategy is doing a few occasional shoulder exercises, such as making arm circles, while seated. And it might be fun to dance and move the arms in time to music, which works the shoulder muscles or to place a ball against a wall and roll the ball in small letter shapes from A to Z, which works all of the muscles in the shoulders. Isometric exercises that engage the muscles without movementsuch as wall squats and planksmay help lower blood pressure more than other types of strength training. Experts have speculated about a possible mechanism During isometric exercise, clenched muscles temporarily constrain blood flow. The following surge of blood may stimulate the release of factors that help relax the vessels and ultimately contribute to a reduction in blood pressure. A strong core serves as the foundation for upper and lowerbody movements. It helps maintain a healthy posture and prevents back injuries and falls. Like all muscles, the core muscles weaken as people age, so its important for people to do core exercises on a regular basis. The best core exercises are movements that activate as many of the core muscles as possible at one time. Some examples include planks, diagonal chops, and deadbugs. A side lunge with a knee lift works the inner and outer thigh muscles and helps improve balance. Flowers, chocolates, organ donation are you in?

For example, losing a little weight can reduce heartburn, knee pain, blood pressure, and diabetes risk. Losing 5 of ones body weight may also lead to better sexual function, more restorative sleep, extra energy, and more selfesteem. To reach a 5 reduction in total body weight, it helps to exercise eat a healthy diet rich in lean proteins, whole grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, and seeds and get enough sleep. Fitness trackers accurately record objective data about physical activity, including the pace, distance, intensity, and duration of exercise. Knowing that something is keeping track of every move can motivate people to stick with a workout. According to a 2023 observational study, greater cardiorespiratory fitness in men was linked to a lower risk of death from colon, lung, or prostate cancer. Running and walking are two of the best exercises and among the easiest to adopt for almost everyone. But it can be easy to get in stuck in a rut. Some ways to reignite the excitement and boost commitment for these activities are to set goals and challenges, enlist a workout buddy, explore new routes, do more interval training, and buy fun accessories. As men age, their metabolism naturally slows, and they burn calories more slowly. They can be less active and consume extra calories. The result is a buildup of visceral fat inside the abdominal cavity and around vital organs. This can raise heart disease risk factors, such as blood pressure, blood sugar, and total cholesterol levels. The best way to fight visceral fat is with aerobic exercise, strength training, and a healthy diet that includes plenty of protein. Fitness levels rapidly diminish when people abruptly stop workouts. Cardiovascular fitness declines within weeks, while muscle strength deteriorates after about two months. The longer a person hasnt exercised, the longer it will take to regain prior fitness levels. To restart exercise, people should seek their doctors approval, especially if they have chronic conditions build up exercise levels slowly do the same types of exercises they once enjoyed find an exercise partner and track progress with wearable devices or by keeping a paper log. Getting regular exercise can help fend off diabetes, even in people with a genetic propensity for the disease, according to a 2023 study. A 2023 study found that people who met guidelines for engaged weekly aerobic activity had a lower risk of dying from pneumonia or influenza than those who did no activity.
