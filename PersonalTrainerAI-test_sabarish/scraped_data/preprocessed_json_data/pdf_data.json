Great! First of all, welcome to the club! Millions and millions of people at one time or another have wanted to lose fat, so you are in great company. However, youre already a bit unlike most of the people that have tried to diet to lose fat in that youre here trying to learn how to do things the right way. And for that, we applaud you. You may be wondering, Does this mean most people have tried to go about their fat loss efforts in the wrong way? Unfortunately, the answer is yes. Fat loss dieting in practice, has, for most people, been a very poorly approached endeavor, and thus something that most people have never been able to achieve with success and sustainability. Sadly, this is largely due to an enormous amount of misinformation that has been swirling around the depths of the fitness industry for decades. But, because youre going to be doing things properly, youll be getting incredible results. So whats the first step in making your fat loss effort as simple and easy as possible? FAT LOSS DIETING MADE SIMPLE 2 1. STANDARDIZING YOUR INTAKE 18 20 62 0500100015002000250030003500 TIME DAYSCALORIES 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14PROTEIN CARBOHYDRATESFATSSTANDARDIZING YOUR MACROS The first thing you need to master in order to have success in your fat loss endeavor is the skill of tracking your caloric intake and macronutrient distribution. In this case, tracking simply means identifying how many grams of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats you eat per day. FAT LOSS DIETING MADE SIMPLE 3 1. Standardizing Your Intake And yes, we mean exactly what youre eating right now with no modifications or exclusions. Are you eating for fat loss right now? Probably not, but thats no big deal! The key is to learn what you are consuming on a regular basis now so that you can modify that intake later for individualized fat loss outcomes. Most people just want a plan they can start executing immediately, but the best fat loss plans are very individualized. And, if you dont know your current baseline consumption, you wont be able to design an effective program that makes good sense in the context of your current baseline consumption. So, for now, you just need to focus on tracking your daily proteins, carbohydrates, and fats, which are commonly referred to as macronutrients or macros in fitness lingo. How do you do this? All you need to do is download the free version of MyFitnessPal or another reputable calorie and macronutrienttracking app and get to work. And just to be clear, its important to track things as accurately as possible using a food scale or at the very least measuring cups and other utensils that offer somewhat stan dardized results. In other words, you dont want to make a peanut butter and jelly sand wich and then type peanut butter and jelly sandwich into the MyFitnessPal database. Ideally, you should be scanning the barcode on the loaf of bread and using a food scale to determine how many grams of peanut butter and jelly you used. If youre super new to tracking your intake and still find it a bit confusing or overwhelm ing, we highly recommend starting with the Healthy Eating Made Simple book YouTube series and coming back to this resource afterward. After about a week or two, youll regularly be able to know how many macronutrients you consume per day, which is exactly what you need to set up the next step in this process. If you think about your fat loss effort as analogous to building a house, identifying your current caloric and macronutrient consumption is much like understanding the foun dation of the house. With a proper understanding of the specifics of the foundation, you can more accurately proceed to the next step of building the house, which is the development of the structure itself. And in this case, the development of the structure represents the creation of your customized fat loss plan. FAT LOSS DIETING MADE SIMPLE 4 2. CHOOSING HIGH QUALITY FOODS In the last section, you learned the importance of tracking your diet and getting a feel for how many grams of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats you consume per day. Although its good to know where your diet is as far as your macronutrient consumption is concerned, its arguably equally important to consider the composition of your macro nutrient consumption. For example, are you eating 300 grams of carbohydrates per day from chocolate syrup and butter cream icing? Or are you getting those 300 grams of carbohydrates from a wide range of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes? This is essentially the consideration of how much you eat versus how much of what you eat. Yes, how much you eat matters, but choosing the right kinds of foods can make an impact ful difference as well. Since your fat loss diet is going to be made out of the bricks of your daily food intake, we want to make sure those bricks are highquality bricks before we start stacking them up to form the structure of your daily diet. Fortunately, the practical application of this idea is quite simple and full of common sense. By consuming mostly the healthiest sources of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats, you can simultaneously boost fat loss, retain more muscle, and be healthier the entire time youre losing fat. This doesnt mean that all of your food needs to be healthy, but most of it being healthy will benefit you greatly, even going so far as to keep your energy levels higher and your hunger levels much lower when youre deep into the fat loss diet.

Choosing High Quality Foods Healthier Fat Sources Polyunsaturated and MonounsaturatedHeavy Sources Olive Oil, Canola Oil, Nuts, Nut Butters, Avocados Practically speaking, the best thing you can do for your health is to start incorporating as many of these foods into your current intake as possible. So, over the next few weeks, try to start consuming most of your daily macros the ones we identified in section one from these healthy sources. That being said, you will notice that these recommendations include a broad range of categories in the sense that fresh fruits and lean meats leave plenty of room for flexibility and creativity. But this is a good thing! It literally offers you a nearlyunlimited number of options and combinations of food items to create healthy meals. After a few weeks of healthier eating, youll be ready to start manipulating your macros to really jump into the fat loss process. Additionally, if youre already tracking your macros and eating mostly healthy foods after just a day of fat loss dieting, you can start the process in the next section as soon as possible without having to settle into tracking and healthy eating for weeks. The bottom line here is this Start section three once you feel very stable in your current healthy diet and no sooner. There are few causes of failure more profound in fat loss dieting than rushing the pro cess. While there is much to gain by being patient and poised in your fat loss journey, there is much to lose by being impatient and immaturely ambitious. FAT LOSS DIETING MADE SIMPLE 9 3. HITTING THE RIGHT MACROS In the first two sections of this ebook, you learned the importance of tracking your macros and how to make sure that most of your intake is coming from healthier foods. Now, youll have to change how much of each macro category youre eating per day so that youre meeting your bodys specific needs as much as possible. For best fat loss outcomes, youll need enough protein to build and spare muscle tissue, enough carbs to provide physical and mental energy, and enough fats to keep your hormonal axes in balance. The question is How much of each macro will you need in order to make sure youre attending to all of those needs? Weve got you covered. MACRO AMOUNTS Protein Intake Approximately 1 gram of protein per pound of bodyweight per day is a good idea for most people looking for best results. For example, this means that a 150pound person would try to consume around 150 grams of protein per day. FAT LOSS DIETING MADE SIMPLE 10 3. Hitting the Right Macros Fat Intake Anything north of 0.3 grams of fat per pound of bodyweight per day is enough to meet most needs for proper hormonal balance and longterm health. Even up to 0.5 grams per pound of bodyweight per day likely wont impinge excessively on your carbohydrate intake at the start of your diet, but eating way more fats than this can prevent your carbohydrates from being high enough to be considered optimal for your fat loss. For example, a 150pound person might choose to consume between 45 and 75 grams of fats per day when they start their fat loss diet. Carbohydrate Intake Once youve accounted for all of the proteins and fats in your diet, youll need to consume carbohydrates to make up the rest of your daily caloric intake. Your calorie target will be whatever total calories youve currently been eating and tracking on a daily average by this point. If you just have the macros and not the calories figured, weve provided a simple way for you to figure out your daily caloric intake here. The Equation grams of daily protein x 4 grams of daily carbohydrates x 4 grams of daily fats x 9 Your T otal Daily Caloric Intake Once youve figured out your calories, you can input your new number of grams of proteins and fats that you have derived from this section of the ebook. In order to calculate your carbohydrates once your proteins and fats have been determined, simply use the following formula carbohydrate grams daily calories grams of protein x 4 grams of fat x 9 4 FAT LOSS DIETING MADE SIMPLE 11 3. Hitting the Right Macros For example, this is what it could look like for a 150pound person eating 2,000 total calories per day TCPD. Protein P 150 grams at 4 calories per gram Fat F 60 grams at 9 calories per gram P F 1,140 calories 2,000 total calories per day 1,140 calories from protein and fat 860 remaining calories for carbohydrates 860 remaining calories 4 calories per gram 215 grams of carbohydrates And there you have your new macros 150 grams of protein, 60 grams of fat, and 215 grams of carbohydrates. However, because your fats can be really anywhere between 0.3 and 0.5 grams per pound per day to begin, there are multiple ways to structure your first round of macros. This is because as long as you get your protein in, and your carbohydrates and fats add up to total your total calories, youre good to go. Whichever ratio of carbohydrates and fats that falls within that range is totally fine, and it can even be different on different days. Some days you might have slightly more fats and fewer carbohydrates, while on others, the opposite may be true. FAT LOSS DIETING MADE SIMPLE 12 3. Hitting the Right Macros PROTEIN CARBS FATS20 20 52 7028 10HIGHER FAT INTAKE HIGHER CARB INTAKEFLEXIBILITY IN MACRO DISTRIBUTION EX 150 LB PERSON As long as your daily calories are about the same and youve met your protein and fat minimums for the day, youre good to go. Eating slightly more carbohydrates might give you more overall energy while eating slightly more fats might let you enjoy a wider variety of foods. And the good news is that there really arent any wrong decisions to be made within this small margin of flexibility. But now that you have your daily food intake sorted down to the calorie and the gram, its time to think about getting a bit more specific with your meals, both in terms of their size and their timing. FAT LOSS DIETING MADE SIMPLE 13 4. CHOOSING MEAL SIZE AND TIMING Now its time to figure out how many meals to eat and when to eat them. There are at least three simple reasons why it pays to structure meals 1. A regular meal schedule has been scientifically shown to be superior for both results and adherence. 2. A regular meal schedule makes meal prep and your daily schedule easier. 3. Proper meal sizing and timing can make your workouts better and more effective while contributing to improved levels of daily energy and enhanced sleep quality. Cool, right? But exactly how many meals should you be eating per day? FAT LOSS DIETING MADE SIMPLE 14 4. Choosing Meal Size and Timing LOW FREQUENCY 1000 CALS1000 CALS1000 CALS 600 CALS600 CALS600 CALS600 CALS600 CALSMEAL SIZING AND TIMING HIGH FREQUENCYEX 3000 CALORIE DIET It turns out that you can actually lose fat very effectively from eating just one meal per day. That may seem crazy, but its true! As long as you hit your daily protein, carbohydrate, and fat targets, most of the effect of fat loss can occur from just one meal. FAT LOSS DIETING MADE SIMPLE 15 4. Choosing Meal Size and Timing That being said, splitting your intake into 35 regular meals per day might allow you to reap some serious benefits such as Improved chances of staving off of hunger More energy for daily tasks More musclesparing nutrient flow More energy for hard training Whether its three, four, or five meals that youre eating per day is much less important than how many calories and macros you eat per day and whether your meals are mostly composed of healthier foods or not. So dont sweat the minutiae and choose either one of the options or a host of options that make sense in the context of your lifestyle and how it ebbs and flows throughout the week. At the same time, please keep in mind that research has confirmed that consistent, simi lar daily meal patterns provide better results and support better health than very chaotic meal schedules. Because of that, its probably wise to stick to just a fixed number of meals 35 on most days. In fact, not only does a similar daily meal number lead to better results, having a relatively set schedule of when during the day you usually eat meals also gives advantages. And on that note, weve provided some key considerations for how to plan out the timing of your meals Try to eat a meal within a few hours after waking. This meal could be immediately after waking or even up to three hours later. Try to consume a postworkout meal within one hour of finishing your training session. So if you complete your training session at 800 AM, it would be smart to eat your postworkout meal before 900 AM. Do your best to eat a meal every six hours at least Try to eat a meal within two hours before bedtime and, in most cases, no closer than 45 minutes before bedtime. FAT LOSS DIETING MADE SIMPLE 16 4. Choosing Meal Size and Timing For example, you might wake at 8 AM and eat breakfast shortly after. Then, you might eat lunch around 1 PM and then train with weights at 6 PM. By 7 PM, youre eating your third meal, and at 1100 PM, an hour before you go to bed, youre finishing your last meal of the day. That would be a pretty good day of eating in terms of timing alone. Now, the question becomes What should you be putting into these meals? And specif ically, how much of your daily proteins, carbohydrates, and fats should be consumed at each meal? On a basic level, the logic of determining permeal macros is the following Protein can be pretty evenly spread across each meal. Theres no need to make your strategy any more complicated than this in most cases. Carbohydrates can usually be consumed in slightly higher amounts in your pre workout and postworkout meals with concomitantly fewer carbs at meals further away from the workout. Fats can be minimized in the pre and especially postworkout meals but included more generously in meals with long intervals before the next meal and in the meal before bed if desired. Fats greatly slow the digestion rate of the proteins and carbohydrates with which they are eaten, leading to more stable energy levels and better hunger reductions. But fats pre and especially post workout can slow down digestion too much and prevent the carbs and fats eaten with them from being absorbed and shuttled to the muscles quickly enough. So, what does this look like when you put it all together? Heres a sample set of meals for a 150pound person similar to our example from section 3 whose daily macros are P150, F60, and C215. From here on, we will use the patterned notation of P150 to indicate 150 grams of protein, F60 to indicate 60 grams of fat, and C215 for 215 grams of carbohydrates. FAT LOSS DIETING MADE SIMPLE 17 4. Choosing Meal Size and Timing Full Day of Eating for a 150Pound Person Waking 830AM Meal 1 1000 AM P40, F20, C40 Turkey bacon, eggs and egg whites, veggies, whole grain English muffin Meal 2 200 PM PreWorkout Meal P35, F10, C60 Turkey sandwich with veggies and light mayo, fruit Begin Workout 500 PM Finish Workout 630 PM Meal 3 700 PM PostWorkout Meal P35, F10, C90 Meat sauce pasta with grilled veggies on the side Meal 4 1000 PM P40, F20, C25 Greek yogurt with berries and nut butter Bedtime 1155 PM Remember, your meal plan can and sometimes maybe even should be a bit different day to day due to your potentially different waking, workout, workschool, and sleeping schedule. But, every day of eating on your fat loss diet plan should have a core similarity if success is to be maximized. This is especially true if youre planning on making a lot of similar meals ahead of time and in bulk by refrigerating or freezing them for later in the week. You dont have to do this, but we highly recommend meal prepping in bulk if youre able to do so. It can reduce your stress levels immensely, allowing you to eat goalspecific meals while minimizing mental fatigue and any deviation from proper adherence as much as possible. FAT LOSS DIETING MADE SIMPLE 18 5. SUPPLEMENTS AND HYDRATION At this point, your diet is just about ready to help you lose serious amounts of body fat. But, before you do that, lets get you squared away with your hydration and consider which supplements might be able to help you on your fat loss journey. Since this is a part of our Made Simple series, well cut right to the chase and let you know how to best stay hydrated If youre peeing offyellow or clear often, youre probably pretty hydrated. A strong stream of offyellow or clear urine every few hours is a good sign of healthy hydration. If youd like, you can have an extra 812 ounces of fluid before hard workouts just to top off. Particularly intense workouts, especially ones in which you sweat a lot, may require you to drink fluids throughout the session. In this case, the ideal fluid for fat loss is a caloriefree fluid with some electrolytes in it, but just plain water works fine as well. If you have a roughly similar daytoday fluid consumption, this stability can help you with future bodyweight tracking and diet change decisions. Drastically overconsuming and underconsuming fluids in any one day can increase or decrease your body weight on the scale the morning after, which can make decisions about dietary changes a bit harder to make. And thats it! Thats as complicated as hydration has to be. Now, lets talk about supplements. FAT LOSS DIETING MADE SIMPLE 19 5. Supplements and Hydration There are probably only a few supplements that are for sure worthwhile to even consider during a fat loss phase in most cases. Here they are with a few notes regarding their practicality Whey Protein Whey protein can be used intra and postworkout with carbohydrates. Using it may have a very small effect on your muscle retention. Regular food works just fine, so there is no need to buy this unless youre really interested. Casein Protein Casein protein can be used for a slowrelease effect before bed or during busy times. It can also mix with whey for an easy meal replacement shake. Dairy products are full of it, so feel free to just stick to lean dairy. But, if you want some casein powder to make quick shakes or some pudding before bedtime, it might be a good idea to think on. Creatine Creatine works well when it comes to maintaining muscle mass during dieting phases. If youre going to use it, buy the monohydrate kind only, and start it a week before you begin your fat loss phase. Creatine might add about five pounds to your bodyweight at first, but thats pretty much all in your muscles and comes off as fast as it went on. FAT LOSS DIETING MADE SIMPLE 20 5. Supplements and Hydration Stimulants Caffeine is the most common stimulant, which can be found in many coffees, teas, and preworkout drinks. It can be used intelligently in graded manner. Use as little as you need to power your workouts, squash hunger, and help mitigate any lack of focus on lowcalorie dieting protocols. Monitor your intake for sleep purposes by ceasing all or nearly all caffeine consumption after midday so that you can sleep well. Sleep is the most powerful supplement for fat loss by far, so dont take anything that keeps you from it. You can use other supplements if youd like, but the ones listed are probably the most effective ones outside of advanced drugs like Ozempic that only your medical doctor can prescribe. In reality, there are no magic fat loss supplements. Stimulants can work, but they need to be used judiciously if you choose to use them. Similarly, multivitamin can be a good idea, but it definitely isnt a requisite. Any major store brand should work just fine, so theres no need to break the bank on special multivitamins from the uppity, overpriced health store. Remember that hydration is also not a big deal in most cases, and you should have no problem staying hydrated with regular nocalorie drinks like water, water with zerocalo rie flavor drops, and diet drinks of any kind. Thats about it. And now its time to discuss the calorie deficit, which is the most powerful fat loss catalyst of them all. FAT LOSS DIETING MADE SIMPLE 21 6. CREATING A CALORIE DEFICIT At this point, your fat loss diet is really coming together. You have your food types and portions sorted into meals, youre in the know about how to count macros in the context of a relatively stable meal plan, you know how much youre eating on a daily basis, and youre on top of your supplement and hydration strategy. For some folks, this process can take months to get right and settled in. For other folks, especially ones who have dieted with other methods before, the entire process might take as long as one bulk cooking meal prep session takes. No matter where youre coming from on this, its super important that you take as much time as you need to feel comfortable with executing the process before you move onto this next step here. Why? Because this next step, even when done in a safe, sustainable way, will make you a bit less comfortable . And thats on purpose. As the old adage goes, discomfort is the mother of progress. Now that you have all of your diet basics put in place, youre ready to walk the fat loss path. Your most powerful allies on this path will be regular weight training andor vigorous activity of any kind, and a caloric reduction into a deficit. When your body takes in fewer calories per day than it burns, the resultant energy to power your body and its daily tasks has to come from somewhere else. FAT LOSS DIETING MADE SIMPLE 22 6. Creating a Calorie Deficit Because your lifting andor other physical activity keeps most of your muscle from being used for this purpose, the only realistic remaining tissue that can be used for this energy need is body fat itself! Your goal will be to lose a certain average amount of weight per week. If youre a relative beginner and you dont have a lot of prior successful diet experience, aiming to lose around 0.5 of your current body weight per week for about 69 weeks is probably wise. If youre advanced and have had numerous successful fat loss diets in your recent past, you can crank up the intensity of your diet as high as 1.0 of your body weight per week for up to 12 weeks if desired.

FAT LOSS DIETING MADE SIMPLE 23 6. Creating a Calorie Deficit Think about it. If you dont know how to drive a stick shift and have never driven a race car very fast before or even your own car, would it be a good idea to rent a Lamborghini? No, those cars are best suited for folks who have been driving fast in similar cars for a long time. And, while crashing a Lambo can risk life and limb, crashing your body on a diet can risk rapid weight regain, a poor relationship with future food intake, and just generally a really unfortunate fat loss experience. Once you know how much weight youd like to lose per week by multiplying your own current body weight by anywhere between 0.5 and 1.0, you can choose the magnitude of the caloric deficit via the following chart CALORIE CUTS 500 calories down from baseline diet 1 pound of loss per week 750 calories down from baseline diet 1.5 pounds of loss per week 1,000 calories down from baseline diet 2.0 pounds of loss per week WEIGHT LOSS METRICS CALORIE DEFICITWEIGHT LOSS PER WEEK LBSWEIGHT LOSS PER WEEK 500 CALORIES 1 LBS 0.6 750 CALORIES 1.5 LBS 1 1000 CALORIES 2 LBS 1.3EX 150 LB PERSON FAT LOSS DIETING MADE SIMPLE 24 6. Creating a Calorie Deficit In essence, each 500calorie daily deficit creates about a pound of weight loss per week, so you can do the math yourself if youd like to be more precise. In fact, lets go through a quick example of this kind of math together right now to help illustrate the point. All you will need is the following 1. Your current bodyweight 2. Your weight loss goal in decimal form of the percentile per week 3. Multiply the figure from 1 by the figure from 2. 4. Multiply the figure from 3 by 500 calories. If we were to apply this to a real world example, we might use the following 1. Your current bodyweight 150 pounds 2. Your weight loss goal 0.5 per week 3. 150 pounds x 0.005 0.75 pounds per week 4. This means that 0.75 pounds of fat loss per week will occur via a daily calorie deficit of approximately 375 calories. Easy, right? Now the trouble here is that you dont actually eat calories just like you dont actually gain pounds. These are just units of measure. You eat real food, and you gain and lose real fat or muscle tissue. So, which foods should you cut down on in order to hit your caloric needs with the fat loss deficit accounted for? FAT LOSS DIETING MADE SIMPLE 25 6. Creating a Calorie Deficit Here are the best practices 1. Try to get at least half that cut just by adding activity. This is easily the best and healthiest way to go about getting fat loss results, and the resultant hunger is much less than if you were simply to cut out only food. Frankly, you can do more activity of any kind, but we recommend getting a wrist band step tracker the cheap ones are totally fine and adding steps to your daily goal. Just googling how many steps con vert to how many calories for your body weight and height should be a breeze. 2. Cut as much of the rest of your calories as you can from fats. You can do this until fats get down to 0.3 grams per pound of body weight or so. If you go any lower, you risk slightly disrupting your bodys normal hormonal balance, and that will make you hungrier, groggier, and less likely to prevent losing muscle. In some cases, the cuts from fat are enough to fill in the rest of the caloric deficit. But, if you need even more calories removed 3. Cut whatever is left from carbohydrates. Yes, its that easy to establish a caloric deficit. And for a few weeks, it will probably work incredibly well in bringing you closer to your fat loss goals. What you will find, however, is that the body adapts, and even our initial estimates of needed calories will be imperfect, so youll have to be prepared to adapt so that you can keep the deficit right in line with your goals. FAT LOSS DIETING MADE SIMPLE 26 6. Creating a Calorie Deficit If you start to lose weight slower due to lower activity levels, slightly slower metabolism, or just because your initial calorie guess wasnt as accurate as you might have hoped, then you are probably well served to remove another 250 daily calories. If youre feeling relatively full after most meals but a bit tired from the extra activity, make more or all of the deficit come from a reduction in food fats if possible and carbohy drates if you run out of reducible fats. If youre more hungry than tired, increase the magnitude of your deficit mostly or exclu sively by increasing your physical activity. If its a bit of both, reduce your food by about 65 of the planned modification to your caloric deficit, and allow increased activity to make up the remaining 35 of it. In other words, if you have to reduce your calories by another 500, perhaps 325 of those should come from reduced food intake and 175 of those should be added to daily activity. Lastly, if you have to repeat this several times during a single diet of 612 weeks, theres no need to worry. Its quite normal! To summarize, this section gave you the formula by which to lose weight for 612 weeks at a safe, impressive pace. A shameless plug here is that the RP Diet Coach App actually does all of this setting up, monitoring, and deficit creation and sustainment for you. So, if you want to keep a thorough record of your diet and results, but youd rather not be doing most of the work yourself, consider downloading the app and trying it out. Hopefully, your diet will wind up being incredibly smooth. On the other hand, many people run into unexpected obstacles during their diet, which is why in the next section, were going to provide you with a few of our most common workarounds so that you can have the most seamless experience possible. FAT LOSS DIETING MADE SIMPLE 27 7. DEALING WITH DIFFICULTIES As you may already be well aware, diets dont always go to plan, and a few predictable complications are likely to manifest themselves primarily in the form of macrofitting, hunger, and water weight problems. MACROFITTING While dieting for fat loss can be a challenge in and of itself, trying to figure out which foods to choose so that you can meet your mealbymeal and daily macro goals can be tougher still. This is especially true when you are trying to eat on the fly, busy, or when your fat allotments are so low that many typical goto foods are temporarily off the list. In such predicaments, you can definitely use an app like the RP Diet Coach App to make things easier. But, with or without the app, you can make your dieting experience much simpler if you choose about 24 basic proteins, vegetables, carbohydrates fruits andor whole grains, and healthy fats. Once youve made those choices, make some meal combinations out of them, and then prep those meal combinations in bulk and shove the preportioned meals into your refrigerator and freezer. This way, when youre busy trying to handle the rest of your life, eating to your diet needs is one thing you only have to think about once or twice a week when you do your FAT LOSS DIETING MADE SIMPLE 28 7. Dealing with Difficulties bulk meal prep. If time is a lot of money to you, you may want to consider a meal prep andor bulk foods service. Lastly, youll want to think of and possibly have on hand some ontherun mealmaking foods such as lean beef or turkey jerky, fruits, nuts, and protein bars or shakes. This way, youre never caught off guard. After all, fortune favors the prepared, right? I could be wrong, but I think thats a tattoo John Wick has on his back. But essentially, these are our primary tips for how to fit foods simply, easily, and effec tively into your macronutrient targets. HUNGER Hunger can be incredibly mentally and physically challenging. In fact, when youre hungry, sticking to your diet can be one of the hardest things you have to do. Evolution has primed pretty much all of us to switch to foodseeking and eatasmuch asyoucan mode when were very hungry, and indulging when hungry is probably the number one reason most people fail on their diets. As you lose more and more fat, your body and brains ancestral antihunger mechanisms will activate more and more. While loads of people fall off the wagon due to rising levels of hunger, you can be ready to tackle hunger head on and get a winning edge. A big part of the task is antici pating hunger and sticking to the plan regardless. FAT LOSS DIETING MADE SIMPLE 29 7. Dealing with Difficulties TIPS FOR MANAGING HUNGER EAT MORE FILLING FOODS EAT LESS TASTY FOODS SHIFT MEALS TO WHEN YOURE HUNGRIEST But, theres more you can do. 1. Eat more filling foods as you feel hungrier. a. Veggies, fruits, yogurts, and very lean protein sources have great hunger reduction calorie ratios. 2. Eat fewer tasty foods as you feel hungrier. a. Sometimes, supertasty foods just make you want more of them. Many of us have experienced this temptation in the attempt to eat just a single potato chip or just one bite of a moist chocolate chip cookie. In short, tastier foods make it increasingly difficult to combat hunger. b. On the other hand, you will be nice and full after eating minimally flavored eggs and oats. That kind of stinks, huh? But, it meets your nutritional needs and doesnt leave you starving and cravey for hours after. And, you can eat loads of tasty food later in the year when youre already leaner after a successful fat loss diet. For now, you have to do what it takes! And the weird bonus here is that if you get lean and hungry enough, even the bland eggs and oatmeal will taste good. FAT LOSS DIETING MADE SIMPLE 30 7. Dealing with Difficulties 3. Choose bigger meals during predictably hungrier times. a. If youre not a morning eater, just have some lean protein and veggies or even a protein shake. This lets you save more of your carbohydrates and fats for later meals during which youll be hungrier like a dinner with the family for example. With these three tips in mind, youll be best prepared to fight against your hunger cues. WATER WEIGHT PROBLEMS Lastly, we need to discuss water weight problems. Sometimes you can be losing lots of fat tissue but the scale weight is barely budging or even going down at all. This can occur because youre slowly storing more and more body water than usual. In a feature of truly dark and hilarious irony, your new extra body water is often stored just under the skin of your problem areas and is really hard to tell apart from fat. So not only do you weigh the same for days or even weeks on end while struggling through a big caloric deficit, you also look very similar in all of your problem areas. Ugh! But, worry not, weve got some tips for you. Much of the tendency to store extra body water is caused by stress. If you try to relax a bit more and sleep a bit more, you can flush out a lot of body water and see enormous reductions on the scale and exciting improvements to your appearance. Additionally, when you get really hungry, you might be the kind of person that starts to add extra flavor to your normal diet foods. This is a perfectly natural tendency and often results in the adding of lots of salt. FAT LOSS DIETING MADE SIMPLE 31 7. Dealing with Difficulties Why? Because as were all painfully aware of, fat is the real heavy lifter of flavor, and when youre not able to add it because it would disrupt your caloric deficit, you go to its trusty sidekick, which is salt. Now, salt by itself doesnt interfere with either fat loss or weight loss, but it does one thing very well, which is to attract and potentially store lots of body water. When you eat more salt, you tend to become thirstier. Then, you drink more water to chase the salt, and thats how your body fluids can increase in amount. To make matters worse, we all tend to crave sweet things when were hungry. Fortunately, we can get an infinite amount of sweetness from artificially sweetened drinks like diet sodas. Thats no problem by itself, and you can have as many as you want, but in combi nation with salt, things can get a bit tricky. Youre already prone to body water retention when youre stressed. So now, you con sume more salt and that makes you thirstier. Then, you turn to sweet tasting drinks and you overdrink them because especially on a diet they just taste so good! Now that youre overhydrated, youll never guess what one of your bodys responses is to make you crave even more salt. As you can imagine, this can be extremely frustrating! The result is that your weight may not drop and could even climb over a period of days or weeks. Not only can this make tracking your caloric deficit a tough task, it can straight up demoralize you. All that restriction for little or no weight loss can get to nearly anyone. In order to prevent this cycle from getting out of hand, if you notice that youre drinking more fluids and eating more salt than usual, just limit your salt to something reasonable even a bit higher than usual is totally fine, and cap the number of artificially sweetened beverages you take in at some number. It can be 10 sodas a day for all anyone cares as long as its not ever more than 10, or whatever number you chose, for the remaining duration of the fat loss diet. Once you standardize your salt and sweetened fluid intake, your body water will stabilize and then reduce and will then be out of the way for you to track your body weight and visual appearance progress. FAT LOSS DIETING MADE SIMPLE 32 7. Dealing with Difficulties Alright, so thats a lot of ammunition for you to succeed in accomplishing your goals and finishing your fat loss diet. If and when you finish your diet, you should be very proud of yourself because youve done what most havent. But, much like just closing the door behind you doesnt get rid of the witch chasing you through the haunted house, even when it seems like its over, the diet isnt yet over! Oh no, another diet after the diet? To some extent, yes, but maybe its more like a long car ride away from the burning haunted house while you still keep an eye out but relax more and more the further away you get. Too many Halloween analogies? Probably, so lets just get to the next section and learn how to do what most people find to be even more difficult than the fat loss diet itself keeping the weight off once the fat loss diet is over. FAT LOSS DIETING MADE SIMPLE 33 8. THE MAINTENANCE PHASE In the last section, you learned how to prepare for the ofteninevitable difficulties that can arise during a fat loss plan. Fortunately, if you apply yourself diligently, you can finish your fat loss diet way leaner than when you started, which can represent a significant part of your overall goal. But wait, why wouldnt losing the fat represent 100 of the goal? After all, isnt this entire resource about losing fat? Close, but not quite. Losing weight for just an instant at the end of your fat loss diet isnt enough. Almost all of us that diet to lose fat want at least some of that weight and fat to stay off for good! And heres the big problem At the end of a fat loss diet, your body and brain are primed to try to get you to put as much of the weight you lost back on as possible. This priming is termed diet fatigue. Your body and brain evolved in ancestral times that were characterized by massive food insecurity and intermittent periods of starvation. So when you lose lots of fat consistently over time, your body and brain detect high levels of diet fatigue and think youre going to starve to death. So when you ease up on the caloric restriction, they try to get you to eat as much as possible and move as little as possible so that you regain your lost weight and ensure your survival against death by starvation. Of course, in the modern world in which you live, starvation likely isnt much of a threat, but excess fat gain is a big and ever present threat. FAT LOSS DIETING MADE SIMPLE 34 8. The Maintenance Phase With that in mind, you have to be very careful what you do once the fat loss phase of your diet is over so that you can prevent weight regain and maintain your leaner physique for as long as you want. Such prevention of regain and support of maintenance is so important that it requires its own phase of dieting right after the fat loss phase is over. In fact, most maintenance phases will need to be somewhere between ⅔ to just as long as your diet phase was in order to clean the slate and allow you to eat and be active relatively normally without risking massive, unintentional weight regain. The biggest thing to remember is that when your fat loss diet ends, you are not yet done with the dieting process . In other words, youre not stopping the fat loss diet and just going to an all you can eat buffet. Youre still on a diet, but its a maintenance diet instead of a fat loss diet. 5 STEPS FOR AN EFFECTIVE MAINTENANCE PHASE STEP 1 Stick to your diet foods. We highly recommend NOT going off and having only junk for days on end. Poise yourself and remember that there will be a time for junk later on when your body is ready! STEP 2 Add 50 of your deficit back into your diet. For example, if you started your diet at 3,000 calories and arrived at 2,000 calories by the end of your fat loss phase, go to 2,500 as soon as possible on the very first day of maintenance. Be sure to make these caloric additions in diet food, so there still wont be any junk foods or cheat meals just yet. Diet foods are the same foods youve been eating toward the end of your fat loss diet. Think chicken and brown rice, not cookies and candy. FAT LOSS DIETING MADE SIMPLE 35 8. The Maintenance Phase STEP 3 Watch your weight. You should gain about 23 of your body weight just from postdiet water weight. This is no big deal and will drop soon! Youre better off expecting it beforehand rather than being surprised in the moment. As soon as your water weight gain starts to fall back down, add in another 250 calories of diet food into your diet. STEP 4 Stabilize. After 34 weeks of adding in 250 daily calories as your weight starts to fall below its new normal again and again, your weight should stabilize, which means you wont have to make adjustments anymore. You wont really be very hungry or cravey anymore, as youve now had weeks of eating exclusively healthy foods aka diet foods in high quantities. Youll be eating plenty of diet food and maintaining at below 102 of your postdiet weight! At this point, you might even be sick of eating this much food, which is a great place to be psychologically after weeks of hunger and cravings dominating your daily experience. STEP 5 Introduce junk food. After you are stable, which means a stable weight and minimal hunger or crav ings, you can have a fun treat big or small here and there. Just remain active, and if your weight trends up for two weeks, ease up on the snacks and clamp down on your daily fats just a bit, which should return your weight back to your new baseline. Its going to take another three or four weeks for your weight to stabilize with the rein troduction of junk food which means that the maintenance phase after your diet can last for months and often will. But once you get through it, your chances of keeping the fat off for a long time skyrocket. FAT LOSS DIETING MADE SIMPLE 36 8. The Maintenance Phase As long as you eat mostly healthy foods with the occasional fun snack, stay active, keep training, and keep an occasional eye on your weight, you can transition from a main tenance phase into a state of living in balance with food and physical activity, all while happier and much healthier at your new, leaner weight. HEALTHY FOODSTREATS 8020PROPORTION OF HEALTHY FOODS AND TREATS If you have a few weeks of a bit too many fun snacks and your weight trends upward, just take two weeks or even 12 days of eliminating junk foods and tightening up your macros a bit, and youll be back to equilibrium in no time. This is sustainable weight loss made possible. But, what if just the one fat loss phase isnt enough for your preferences. What if you want to lose more weight to get even lighter and leaner in the long term? Well discuss those considerations in section 9. FAT LOSS DIETING MADE SIMPLE 37 9. LONG TERM FAT LOSS One fat loss phase coupled with a maintenance phase can let you lose serious pounds of fat and upgrade your health, physique and wellbeing substantially. But, you might want to lose more than just one fat loss phases worth of fat. In section 6, you learned that even advanced dieters should cap their total weight loss rate at 1 per week and their total weeks spent in a fat loss phase at 12 weeks at a time. Accounting for water weight changes and the fact that most people wont combine the most aggressive weekly weight loss rate with the highest number of weight loss weeks in a fat loss phase, we come to the idea that the most weight the majority of people should aim to lose in a single fat lossmaintenance combination is around 10 of their starting bodyweight. If you weighed 200 pounds when you started your last fat loss phase, you might be around 180 pounds at the end of the maintenance phase that follows. So, what do you do if you want to eventually walk around and live in a state of balance at 150 pounds? The right approach is to start another fat loss phase after the maintenance phase of your last fat loss diet concludes. However, this fat loss phase should account for the fact that youre already down a lot of weight from the previous fat loss phase and should thus have at least three features. First, it should only be started if you essentially have zero detectable diet fatigue when youre considering starting again. This means pretty much zero unusual hunger, cravings, or prolonged low energy states. You should feel 100 ready and confident for another fat loss phase, with pretty close to zero honest thoughts that resemble anything like, Oh boy, this is going to be really tough and Im not sure if I can make it through. FAT LOSS DIETING MADE SIMPLE 38 9. Long Term Fat Loss If you arent there yet, just keep running your maintenance phase for longer until you are. Fat loss dieting again before youre ready puts you at a huge risk for falling off the wagon and regaining even the last phases lost weight. Second, every successive fat loss phase after your first should aim to lose a slightly smaller percentage of your current weight than the prior phase. For example, if you lost 10 of your body weight in the last fat loss phase, you should probably aim to lose something like 8 in your next phase. And, if youre going to do another phase later, something like 6 in that one could make sense and so on. PHASE 1 PHASE 2 PHASE 3 FAT LOSS P HASES OF BODYWEIGHT LOST 051015BODYWEIGHT LOST THROUGH SUCCESSIVE FAT LOSS PHASES FAT LOSS DIETING MADE SIMPLE 39 9. Long Term Fat Loss Once you get to about 5 weight loss per phase, you dont have to reduce the number anymore, but until and if you do, every successive fat loss phase should be slightly less ambitious than the next. Ideally, you could just aim to lose 10 of your body weight every time, but that might lead to falling off the wagon. Why? Because your body has shorter term weeks and months and longer term months and years physiological steadystate axes. Even if you feel fairly fresh after a maintenance phase, at least for years to come, your body will always try to pull you just a bit into the upward, weightregain direction. This pull makes every successive fat loss phase notably harder than the last one, and, so as not to set unrealistic goals and burn out, you must adjust your expectations and plan accordingly. Lastly, every maintenance phase that follows every successive fat loss phase should, on average, be longer than you would normally expect for a fat loss diet of that duration. In other words, if your maintenance phase after your first fat loss phase was eight weeks long, the one after your next fat loss phase may need to be 10 weeks long to accomplish similar reduction of diet fatigue, and the third maintenance phase may need to be a whole 12 weeks long, and so on. Is this ideal? Of course not! It would be amazing if you could just do one long fat loss diet phase to drop all the weight off at once, complete one short maintenance phase to reduce diet fatigue back to zero, and enjoy your new life at your preferred new level of leanness. But, reality is a youknowwhat, and in order to achieve the best long term diet success, you have to chunk up your total weight loss and take your time accomplishing it through successive and shorter fat loss phases and longer maintenance phases. If youve stacked enough fat loss and maintenance phases together to lose all the long term weight to get to your final goal, just keep one more thing in mind its likely a good idea to diet to push to about 34 body weight below your final goal weight. This extra buffer is to account for water weight regain and the slight regain in tissue that a proper return to balanced living will necessitate. This way, when all is said and done six months after the end of your last fat loss phase, you can live in balance at your actual goal weight and feel great about it. FAT LOSS DIETING MADE SIMPLE 40 9. Long Term Fat Loss Lastly, just remember that, if you were ever 50 pounds or more above your final post fat loss weight, that there will nearly always be a pull back up. Your body and brain will always fight you just a bit as you try to maintain your new weight. When most people go on a holiday binge and gain 35lbs, you might be the person that gains 510lbs. In order to obviate this possibility, your best weapons will be to stay super active on a regular basis, to have a core of fundamentally healthy eating habits this means that going completely off the rails for weeks on end is unlikely to serve you well, and allow for a nojunk tightening up of your diet for a few weeks here and there if your weight floats up a bit again. Be realistic, be patient, and be consistent, and you can change your body to a massive and ultrabeneficial degree. In the next section, well talk about what to do if you want to take the journey into being exotically lean. LIVING IN BALANCE FAT LOSS DIETING MADE SIMPLE 41 10. GETTING EXOTICALLY LEAN Okay, so youve done a few fat loss phases and maintenance phases, youve lived in balance in a pretty lean state and loved it, but now, youve got the itch! The itch, that is, to try to get exotically lean. First of all, what does it mean to be exotically lean? For males, being exotically lean means getting to below 10 body fat. For females it means getting to below about 17 body fat. We term these body fat levels exotically lean for a few reasons. To begin, these levels are very difficult to attain. Its going to require a lot of effort on your part while being extremely careful in how you treat your body to even get into these realms in most cases. Second, once you get exotically lean, it wont be overly fun to stay there. In fact, staying there can put quite a bit of physical and psychological stress on your body, which is why getting this lean is almost always an exercise in temporary appearance modification and not a permanent change. That is, there is really no living in balance at 4 body fat. At best, youd just be visiting every now and again. Lastly, other than the enjoyment of the temporary visual changes, there is really no upside to getting exotically lean. Its not for everyone, and, in fact, its probably not for most people. You never have to get exotically lean, and oftentimes, even attempting to do so can put you at risk of moderately disordered temporary eating patterns, terrible sleep, high FAT LOSS DIETING MADE SIMPLE 42 10. Getting Exotically Lean stress, higher likelihood of injury in the gym, and even a higher risk of getting sick and taking longer to recover if you get sick. The only upside you can have veins on your abs! Are you still interested? If you are, lets take a look at how to do it correctly. Before you endeavor to get exotically lean, you need to do two things. First, you need to diet down to the cusp of exotic leanness. Then, with no rebounding, you need to stay there for a nice long maintenance phase, until your diet fatigue is very low or nominal. Just like high altitude climbers get to their base camp and rest and acclimate before making their summit attempt, youll need to get down to around 10 as a male or 17 as a female and maintain there until you feel really, really good about doing another very tough diet. In fact, it will likely be the toughest diet you have ever done! In addition, before you descend into exotically lean territory, you need to understand that you will almost certainly be subjected to incredible hunger, cravings, low energy, poor sleep, and mood swings. If that seems like a bit much for you, dont do it because youre missing out on basically nothing! But if youre good with this, expect it, and prepare yourself. Weight training is also a must here as getting ultra lean without weight training will cause very unwanted levels of muscle loss, which could leave you looking much more like Christian Bale in The Machinist than Christian Bale in Batman Begins. Once you begin your diet, its a very wise idea to aim for no longer than 12 weeks total of dieting, but also at no more than a 0.5 weekly weight loss goal in most cases. If youre doing the math at home, this means youll lose perhaps up to 6 of your body fat, which for males means getting down to potentially 4 body fat and for females to around 10 body fat. FAT LOSS DIETING MADE SIMPLE 43 10. Getting Exotically Lean At levels that low, things get pretty crazy, so our major recommendation here is to con sider hiring a coach that specializes in helping competitive physique athletes like body builders and figure competitors get stagelean. This doesnt mean you have to compete at the end of your exotically lean journey, but it does mean that youll have someone who has helped a plethora of other people through the very same process and can help you when you need it most. They can fill in the blanks on diet specifics, cardio, water and salt intake, and other small factors that can align to make you look your very best, especially at the end of the diet when its time to take pictures and let social media do the bragging for you. Finally, because the risk of massive, uncomfortable weightrebounding after a diet that gets you exotically lean is very high, you need to manage your regain phase. Yes, we are suggesting that you should manage your regain phase and not your mainte nance phase because you cannot expect to maintain exotic leanness . At the very least, you should gain about 1 of your body weight back per week for about six weeks after your exotic diet is over. Once that is done and youre back around the cusp of exotic leanness again, then you can switch to a traditional maintenance diet and take a few weeks to train less and really recover for your next fitness journey. The regain back up by 1 per week means you pretty much have to take your preexotic maintenance diet where you stayed at 10 of 17, male and female respectively and add in about 250 to 500 calories on top of it. Keep in mind that you are intentionally trying to add body fat, so once youre nice and full after a few weeks of only healthy food, its okay to start having some fun snacks here and there to keep regaining. If you train ultra hard with weights during this time, you might even gain some decent muscle, and the training will be super fun because youll look your best ever in the gym! And thats all weve got when it comes to fat loss dieting made simple, folks! FAT LOSS DIETING MADE SIMPLE 44 10. Getting Exotically Lean Remember to be consistent, to be patient, and to enjoy the process no matter what your body fat percentage may be. Because getting lean only guarantees being lean. It doesnt guarantee being happy, and, in the end, thats what its all about. If youd like to consume this guide in video form, you can do that via our Fat Loss Dieting Made Simple series on YouTube.

STANDARDIZING YOUR INTAKE So you want to diet to gain muscle. Great! There are a lot of people who have already done this and many more who are currently trying to do the very same thing, so welcome to the club! Now, while many wellintentioned people will put in an incredible effort toward their musclebuilding dieting endeavor, a large fraction of those people will wind up doing a few too many things wrong, which, as you might imagine, typically leads to suboptimal and underwhelming results. You, on the other hand, are going to get spectacular results simply because youve found one of the best resources the fitness industry can offer. Once youve absorbed all of the information in this particular guide, you will be far ahead of most people in your understanding of how to diet effectively to put on as much muscle as possible. So, where do we start? The first thing to think about when it comes to musclegain dieting is your current state of affairs in terms of your habits surrounding nutrition. The primary variable here is simply how much food youre eating. Proper muscle gain dieting revolves heavily around consuming the right amount of food, and, because every one is different, basic calorie intake formulas might not work as well as taking a more indepth look at your own current diet and making more advanced adjustments. So, instead of giving you a generic plan to follow that may or may not work, youll be developing your own musclegain diet plan over the course of this guide so that you MUSCLEGAIN DIETING MADE SIMPLE 2 1. Standardizing Your Intake can start moving down a path that leads you to great results without any unnecessary guesswork. To understand your current state of diet affairs, tracking your food intake for about two weeks is a good idea. This can be done best by using the free version of an app like MyFitnessPal to count your daily macros proteins, carbohydrates, and fats and your caloric intake. If youre on the newer end of tracking your macros and calories and need a simpler approach, check out our Healthy Eating Made Simple guide and corresponding YouTube series before diving too far into your understanding of musclegain dieting. The concepts outlined in those resources will undoubtedly give you an important foundational understanding of how to eat for longterm health, which you can then build upon once youre ready to put on some hardearned muscle. MUSCLEGAIN DIETING MADE SIMPLE 3 1. Standardizing Your Intake Graph 1 After about two weeks of tracking, youll know your daily averages for how many pro teins, carbohydrates, and fats youre taking in, and these data points will serve as the foundation for the changes well make that will transform your current diet into a diet designed specifically toward helping you put on muscle. 18 20 62 0500100015002000250030003500 TIME DAYSCALORIES 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14PROTEIN CARBOHYDRATESFATSAfter about two weeks of tracking, youll know your daily averages for how many proteins, carbohydrates and fats youre taking in, and these data points will serve as the foundation for the changes well make that will transform your current diet into a diet designed speciﬁcally toward helping you put on muscle.AVERAGE MACRONUTRIENT INTAKE If youre already familiar with your average daily macronutrient intake, just skip this step and move onto section two. MUSCLEGAIN DIETING MADE SIMPLE 4 2. CHOOSING HIGH QUALITY FOODS Standardizing and tracking your intake is a great start, but now that you know how much food youre eating, its time to make sure youre eating the right kinds of food. Because after all, if your diet is mostly Twinkies and lard, you could certainly be eating better for muscle gain! By taking in foods from mostly the right kinds of sources, you can make sure that your macros are met in the most nutritious ways possible. This will result in greater health as you gain muscle, which is important because health is the core foundation of the hard training in the gym youll also be doing to gain muscle. By eating the right kinds of foods, youll also be making sure your pumps in the gym are maximized, your energy levels are as high as they can be, and your musclegrowth training is as productive as possible. Lastly, highquality sources of food, especially protein, simply pack on more muscle gram for gram than lowerquality sources. What constitutes these highquality sources? Lets take a look. MUSCLEGAIN DIETING MADE SIMPLE 5 2. Choosing High Quality Foods HEALTHY MUSCLEGAINING FOOD COMPOSITION Protein Sources Lean Meats 9010 or leaner Lean Dairy Products 1 fat or leaner Lean, HighQuality Vegan Sources HIGH QUALITY PROTEIN SOURCES LEAN MEATS 9010 OR LEANER LEAN DAIRY PRODUCTS LEAN HIGHQUALITY VEGAN SOURCESMILKFISH STEAK CHICKEN GREEK YOGURT SOY QUORN MUSCLEGAIN DIETING MADE SIMPLE 6 2.

Choosing High Quality Foods Fat Sources Polyand MonoUnsaturatedHeavy Sources Olivecanola oils, nuts, nut butters, avocado Fats from these major categories are an excellent way to boost your caloric intake when needed and are most likely the healthiest nutrients to eat in a caloric surplus. HIGH QUALITY FAT SOURCES POLYAND MONOUNSATURATED HEAVY SOURCES AVOCADONUTS CANOLA OIL OLIVE OIL NUT BUTTERS MUSCLEGAIN DIETING MADE SIMPLE 8 2. Choosing High Quality Foods Now, to be clear, you dont have to consume all of your calories from these healthy sources, but eating a majority of them from this basic selection is probably a good idea if you want to put on the most muscle, the least fat, and stay the healthiest while doing so. Eating between 75 or 85 of your weekly calories from such foods likely puts you into a realm in which eating even healthier only improves your overall outcomes marginally at best. So, if youre serious about gaining muscle the right way, shoot to make four out of every five meals healthy, and then one out of those five can be some junk food. For bonus points, make sure the junk meals are high in protein or consume a protein shake after and youll be off to a productive start. MUSCLEGAIN DIETING MADE SIMPLE 9 3. HITTING THE RIGHT MACROS So far, youve been eating at your usual level of calorie and macronutrient intake, but youve been focused on meeting these needs with mostly healthy foods. Now, we need to zoom in on your macronutrient amounts to make sure youre getting enough of each macronutrient to optimize muscle growth. In muscle building nutrition, protein is critical because its the building block of muscle tissue. Carbohydrates are important because they provide the best kind of training energy, and, in concert with protein, can boost muscle growth on net balance via their effects on insulin and cortisol hormone levels. Lastly, enough fat intake can make sure your general health and hormonal levels are good, which is especially important with regards to hormones like testosterone and estrogen, both of which need to be supported intentionally for maximum muscle growth. The question is How much of each of these macronutrients will your body need to build muscle best? Lets dive in. MUSCLEGAIN DIETING MADE SIMPLE 10 3. Hitting the Right Macros CALCULATING YOUR MACRONUTRIENT INTAKE Protein Intake Consuming roughly 1 g of protein per pound of body weight per day is a good idea for most people looking for best musclegain results. Note that eating more protein than this does not predictably increase your muscular gains. If it did, wed be telling you to eat that amount instead. For example, this means that a 150pound person would aim to con sume around 150 g of protein per day. GRAMS OF PROTEIN PER POUND OF BODYWEIGHTMUSCLE GAIN 102030405060708090100 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 1.1 1.2 GOLDEN ZONEConsuming roughly 1 g of protein per pound of body weight per day is a g ood idea for most people looking for best musclegain results. Note that eating more protein than this does not predictably increase your muscular gains. If it did, wed be telling you to eat that amount instead.CALCULATING MACRONUTRIENT INTAKE For example, this means that a 150pound person would aim to consume around 150 g of protein per day. MUSCLEGAIN DIETING MADE SIMPLE 11 3. Hitting the Right Macros Fat Intake Anything north of 0.3 g per pound of body weight per day is enough to meet needs for proper hormonal balance and longterm health, but values above 0.4 g per pound per day tend to promote even better hormonal environments for muscle growth. Because of this, theres no realistic upper limit on fats for their own sake, but eating too many fats can impinge on the amount of carbohydrates you can have. In most cases, best results are likely to occur with no more than 0.6 g of fat per pound of body weight per day. For example, a 150pound person might consume between 60 g and 90 g of fats per day when they start their musclegain diet. Carbohydrate Intake Once youve accounted for all of the proteins and fats in your diet, youll need to add in carbohydrates to match your target calories. Your calorie target will be whatever total calories youve been eating and tracking on a daily average by this point. If you just have the totals for your macros and not your total calories,, heres a simple formula to determine your calorie consumption. Grams of daily protein x 4 Grams of daily carbs x 4 Grams of daily fats x 9 T otal Calories Once you figure out your calories from your current tracked diet using the above formula, you can plug in your new grams of proteins and fats you have derived from this section of the book. In order to calculate your carbohydrates once your proteins and fats have been determined, simply use the following formula Carbohydrate grams Daily calories protein grams x 4 fat grams x 94 MUSCLEGAIN DIETING MADE SIMPLE 12 3. Hitting the Right Macros Example 150pound person eating 2,000 calories per day Total Daily Caloric Consumption 2,000 Daily Protein Intake P 150 g Daily Fat Intake F 75 g Protein 4 calories per gram, Fat 9, Carbohydrates 4 P F Calories 1,275 calories Remaining Calories 725 calories divided by 4 Daily Carbohydrate Intake C 180 g As long as you get your protein in and your fats stay between 0.4 and 0.6 g per pound of body weight per day, you can consume whichever ratio of carbohydrates to fats that you like. That ratio can even be different on different days or vary in order to accommodate other meals. For example, if you have a highfat meal planned for a restaurant dinner later tonight, you can lower your carbohydrates a bit to compensate and viceversa. As long as youre meeting your protein and daily calorie needs, youre doing most of the heavy lifting pun intended for your musclegain diet Later on in your musclegain diet journey, you can spend a few weeks at the lower end of fat intake 0.4 g per pound of body weight per day and a few weeks at the higher end 0.6 g per pound of body weight per day and see which one makes your food easier and more enjoyable to eat, your digestion more comfortable, your workouts more intense, and your recovery as effective as possible. If you cant realistically tell a difference, just set your average daily fats at 0.5 g and go from there. Theres no reason to make it any more complicated than that. Now that your macros are squared away, its time to look at how many meals youre eating and what they look like. MUSCLEGAIN DIETING MADE SIMPLE 13 4. CHOOSING MEAL SIZE AND TIMING Yes, you could just eat at random times with fluctuating meal and snack numbers and still get great results. But, by having a bit more structure to the content, size, and timing of your meals, you can benefit more in at least three different ways 1. A regular meal schedule has been shown to be superior for both results and adherence in the scientific literature. 2. A regular meal schedule makes meal prep easier and your daily schedule easier to navigate. Eventually, youre going to have to eat a lot of food to gain the most muscle you can, and eating that much food consis tently can be difficult if you just wing it from meal to meal. By prepping food in advance, you align yourself with the prac tices of almost every champion bodybuilder. This isnt to say that you should mimic the behaviors and habits of champion bodybuilders without reason, but in this case, there is a very good reason. 3. Proper meal sizing and timing make your workouts better and more effective, your daily energy higher, and your sleep better. This also allows you to eat more food if needed, even if you have to work around low hunger levels to get it done. For most people seeking maximum muscle size, that may eventually be a reality. MUSCLEGAIN DIETING MADE SIMPLE 14 4. Choosing Meal Size and Timing MEAL NUMBER As peculiar as this may sound, you can eat as little as one meal per day and see results as long as you hit your daily macros. However, eating just one meal a day while trying to gain mass will quickly become an exercise in stomach pain, so eating slightly smaller meals more frequently is probably wise. In addition, a substantial amount of direct research shows that eating three or more meals per day is superior to eating two or fewer meals per day in terms of maximizing muscle gain and minimizing fat gain, so you will see recommendations in this guide following that line of thinking in most cases. Consuming 35 daily meals also works better when it comes to squeezing in more daily calories when needed, providing energy at the right time for training, and avoiding the risk of training on an unnecessarily full stomach to the extent that you may get sick and have a bad workout. How you space out your meals can also affect your results. Ideally, you may want to spread your meals out in a way similar to the following structure 1. A meal within a few hours of waking to begin growing muscle and prevent muscle loss 2. A postworkout meal to fuel muscle growth And ideally, you would consume some food a few hours before your work out as well to power your hard training. This is optional, however, and train ing fasted is totally fine if you train within an hour or so of waking. 3. A meal every six hours at least to present musclebuilding nutrients to your body 4. A meal within two hours of bedtime so that your body has adequate nutrition to build muscle and reduce fatigue while you sleep MUSCLEGAIN DIETING MADE SIMPLE 15 4. Choosing Meal Size and Timing WHEN TO TRAIN NUTRIENT PER MEAL TRAININGMEAL 1 MEAL 2MEAL 3MEAL 4MEAL 5 PROTEIN CARBOHYDRATES FATS Now that your meal timing has been taken care of, lets figure out how many macronu trients to eat per meal. MUSCLEGAIN DIETING MADE SIMPLE 16 4. Choosing Meal Size and Timing MACRONUTRIENT DISTRIBUTION ACROSS MEALS Its important to understand which combinations of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats work best throughout the different meals you eat in a typical day. Heres the breakdown. Protein should be pretty even per meal. Thus, if you eat four meals per day and take in 200 g of protein total, you should eat about 50 g of protein per meal. Eating 40 g is fine, and 60 g is fine too, but eating random meals of 10 g or 90 g might not be ideal. Carbohydrates should usually be higher before a workout and after a workout. For example, if youre eating 400 g of carbohydrates over five meals, the prework out meal can have 100 g of carbohydrates, the workout occurs two hours after, and the postworkout meal can have 150 g of carbohydrates, and the other three meals of the day can have about 50 g of carbohydrates each. In general, fats should stay away from workouts as much as possible. This is especially the case before workouts as they can cause digestive discomfort and interfere with hard training. Fats take longer to digest and slow down the digestion and release of all other macronutrients in the meal in which they are eaten. Therefore, if you eat 100 g of fats per day over three meals, you might want to have 25 g of fats in your preworkout meal, 25 g of fats in your postworkout meal, and 50 g of fats in your third meal later in the day. MUSCLEGAIN DIETING MADE SIMPLE 17 4. Choosing Meal Size and Timing With all that in mind, lets see what a sample musclegaining meal plan for a 150pound lifter might look like. Lets assume their daily macros are the following P150, F80, C300. Meal 1 1000 AM P40, F25, C50 Turkey bacon, eggs and egg whites, veggies, whole grain English muffin Meal 2 200 PM PreWorkout P35, F15, C70 Turkey sandwich with vegetables, cheese, and light mayo, fruit Meal 3 700 PM PostWorkout P35, F10, C140 Meat sauce pasta with grilled vegetables on the side Meal 4 1000 PM P40, F30, C40 Fairlife skim milk with whole grain toast and crunchy peanut butter MUSCLEGAIN DIETING MADE SIMPLE 18 5. SUPPLEMENTS AND HYDRATION Before we start tweaking your calories and macronutrient intake to support your specific goals, lets chat about supplements and hydration. While there are many different types of supplements that claim to build muscle, only a few of the legal ones actually help in any meaningful way. Lets take a quick look at them. SUPPLEMENTS Whey Protein Whey protein can be used intraworkout and postworkout with carbohydrates for advanced lifters. Whey protein is a very high quality protein source and likely has a small but meaningful impact on muscle growth. Regular food works just fine if you dont want to mess with any powders or shakes. MUSCLEGAIN DIETING MADE SIMPLE 19 5. Supplements and Hydration Carbohydrate Powders Carbohydrate powders include products like Gatorade, Powerade, Vitargo, etc. These powders can be mixed with whey protein for intrawork out and postworkout anabolism and energy input. These powders can also be easy on your GI tract when whole foods become difficult to consume. Such carbohydrate sources can be lifesavers when youre eating much more food than youre comfortable with and could benefit from a break from all of the chewing and energyintensive digesting for a bit. When combined with whey protein, these powders are ideal sources of carbohydrates for a postworkout shake if you choose to have one. For those who simply dont seem to get hungry for a while after hard training, using these powders in the postworkout window can be a very effective strategy. What about mass gainers? Mass gainers are usually preformulated combinations of whey or other proteins and easily digested car bohydrates. You can take them if you like, but remember that they are just powdered food. There is nothing magical about them. Creatine Creatine can work extremely well when it comes to adding strength and muscle size. It can also give you a crazy pump! If you choose to take it, buy only the monohydrate variety. For most people, about 5 g of daily creatine taken at any time of the day doesnt have to be around the workout will be effective during their musclegain phase. Note too that creatine will temporarily increase your body weight via added body water, so dont be tempted to think you just gained five pounds of muscle in a week! After a week of taking it, your weight should stabilize and youll have no problem tracking tissue changes fat, muscle from then on. MUSCLEGAIN DIETING MADE SIMPLE 20 5. Supplements and Hydration Stimulants Caffeine is the most common of these, the beststudied, and probably one of the safest. Stimulants can help you power through your hardest musclegain workouts, especially later on in your training phases when fatigue is high. Use as little as you need to power your workouts. Taking a preworkout product is fine if you enjoy it, but keep in mind that coffees, sodas, or even Monsters can work just fine too. If you are sensitive to caffeine, we recommend starting with a third or less of a recommended preworkout formula dose as many preworkouts can be very potent. Watch your intake for sleep purposes and dont consume high amounts of stimulants after midday if sleep is an issue. Lastly, for most people, stimulants have an appetitesuppressive effect, so if youre having trouble eating food, especially after your workout, consider easing up your lmk stimulant intake. Remember, food builds more muscle than stimulants ever will! HYDRATION Lets keep this super simple. First, if youre drinking at least 812 oz of fluids with each meal and can consistently report offyellow or clear urine, youre good to go. Second, you might consider topping off your water about an hour before a hard workout with another 816 oz of caloriefree fluids, especially if you tend to sweat a lot during your workouts. During workouts, drink a little more fluid than youd prefer since thirst can lag a bit behind dehydration during hard workouts. If youre thirstier, drink more. If you feel like MUSCLEGAIN DIETING MADE SIMPLE 21 5. Supplements and Hydration youre drowning in fluids, drink less, and for almost everyone involved in muscle gain, thats about all you need to know. In summary, there really arent any magical musclegain supplements, and hydration is not something to be worried about in most cases. In terms of practical applications on the supplement side of things, feel free to consider taking a daily multivitamin to round out your nutritional intake. As it pertains to hydration, experiment with more or less fluids to see where the line between good urine volume and color and the discomfort of having to pee every hour falls for you. MUSCLEGAIN DIETING MADE SIMPLE 22 6. CREATING A SURPLUS If youve read this far, you know how to organize the very core of your musclebuilding nutrition plan. Actually implementing it may take you a few hours if youve done this before to as many as several weeks or even months if youre new to this and easing into the process. Getting used to this way of eating, however, is critical to longlasting success, so take all the time you need. Remember, you dont get any bonus points for rushing the process to the detriment of your longterm results. Once youre ready and comfortable with the basic plan, its time to switch gears and create the most powerful change the intentional caloric surplus. As long as youre eating well and training hard, eating a bit more calories on the average day than your body burns is a huge factor in adding muscle mass. If you add too few calories to your plan, youll experience needlessly slow gains or acci dentally wind up eating less than the surplus you need due to measurement error. If you add too many calories to your plan, youll likely gain a lot more body fat than you need to in order to gain the muscle you want. From a combination of research and anecdotal experience, weve found that aiming to gain about 0.250.5 of your bodyweight per week over about 816 weeks when seek ing to put on maximum muscle is probably a good approach for most. MUSCLEGAIN DIETING MADE SIMPLE 23 6. Creating a Surplus To that end, adding about 250 daily calories to your alreadycreatedviatherecommen dationsinthisguidesofar plan will result in a likely gain of about half a pound of body weight per week. Similarly, a surplus of about 500 daily calories will result in a likely gain of about one pound of body weight per week. MON TUE WED THUR FRI SAT SUN MON TUE WED THUR FRI SAT SUNCALORIES CALORIES 250 CALORIES 0.5 LBS PER WEEK 500 CALORIES 1 LBS PER WEEKCREATING A SURPLUS As an example, lets do some super easy math in order to determine how big of a calorie surplus you will need in order to gain weight at your desired rate. MUSCLEGAIN DIETING MADE SIMPLE 24 6. Creating a Surplus For this calculation, youll need 1. Your current body weight 2. Your weight gain goal per week as a percentage 3. To multiply your figure from 1 by your figure from 2 4. To multiply the product from 3 by 500 calories Heres an example 1. Your current bodyweight 150 pounds 2. Your weight gain goal per week as a percentage 0.5 per week 3. 150 pounds x 0.005 0.75 pounds per week 4. 0.75 pounds per week will occur 0.75 x 500 calories via 375 daily calorie surplus And there you have it! In this case, an average of 375 extra daily calories, or whatever number you determined by plugging in your own body weight and weight gain goals, is what you would need to consume in order to achieve the aforementioned rate of gain. At this point, we need to determine which combination of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats you should be eating extra on top of your regular intake to fill out that surplus. MUSCLEGAIN DIETING MADE SIMPLE 25 6. Creating a Surplus Broadly speaking, any combination is totally fine, but, for those who are interested in implementing a bit more specificity to their surplus design, you could do the following 1. Try to add as many calories as you can from carbohydrates. Carbohydrates can potentiate pumps, boost energy, facilitate anabolism, and are also very easy to eat, which make them great surplusboosters. 2. Make up as much of the rest of your surplus as you can via healthy fats. This is good practice until fats get much over 0.6 g per pound of body weight. 3. Lastly, if you really cant consistently across a weekly average eat that many calories from healthy food sources, consider the following Throw in a bit of junk to fill in the gaps, but make sure each junk meal has a decent amount of protein in it. For example, if on Saturday you have a pint of ice cream to push in some tasty extra calories, consider having a whey protein shake with it or right after it to make sure your muscle gains stay on track. Its that easy! Well, until and unless it isnt that easy, which is why weve dedicated the next chapter of this guide to dealing with common musclegain dieting difficulties. MUSCLEGAIN DIETING MADE SIMPLE 26 7. DEALING WITH DIFFICULTIES By now, youre well on your way to having this whole musclegaining nutrition thing figured out. And on paper, youve probably noticed that it doesnt seem that hard. But, once you try to put the process meaningfully into action, things can sometimes get a bit more difficult. Specifically, there are a few difficulties in musclegain dieting that are common enough for us to mention in this guide. They are macrofitting, weight stalling, fullness, and excessive body fat gain. MACROFITTING Macrofitting is the process of choosing foods to meet your daily macro needs. Dieting for musclegain can be tough because youll be eating a lot, and trying to figure out what to eat all the time can get tiresome! This is especially true if youre making your food decisions on the fly and even more so if youre not a selfproclaimed big eater to begin with and dont really have any goto favorite meals. One of the best solutions to this problem is to create a list for yourself of about 24 basic protein sources, vegetables, healthy carbohydrate sources in the fruits and grains categories, and healthy fat choices. Combine them to create palatable meals that you cook in bulk, prepackage, and drop into the fridge or freezer. Then, when you need them, theyll be just a microwave but tons click away! MUSCLEGAIN DIETING MADE SIMPLE 27 7. Dealing with Difficulties If your time is very expensive, you can consider a foodprep service like Trifecta, and then the basics are already taken care of for you. Its also a wise idea to consider some on the go meal options that fit your macros such as protein bars, protein shakes, wraps, and burritos. Chipotle or Qdoba are great options in many cases! And although you wont always be able to get exactly what you need, remember that fortune favors the prepared. If you consistently find yourself get ting frustrated by your inability to find macrofriendly meals in a pinch, you may have to become more regimented in the meals you prepare ahead of time and carry with you while traveling. WEIGHT STALLING Weight stalling occurs when youve either miscalculated how much youre really eating or moving, or because your physical activity and metabolic rate have adapted to the higher calories. In such cases, your weight gain slows and then stalls, which is a bad deal because gaining weight is kind of the core foundation of building muscle. If you go more than 12 weeks without gaining any weight, consider adding another 250 calories to your average daily diet. Then, see how that plays out for another 12 weeks and repeat as needed to stay on track in terms of gaining the average amount of weight per week that you planned on in the beginning. This process must work in almost all cases, but pulling it off can lead you into another common musclegain diet challenge fullness. FULLNESS As you gain more and more weight, you will get less and less hungry because, in most cases, your body values homeostasis and will prefer to stay about the same size. At this point, the more you try to eat, the more intense the fullness becomes. As your fullness intensifies even further, this can lead to becoming completely repulsed by eating so much as another tablespoon of peanut butter. MUSCLEGAIN DIETING MADE SIMPLE 28 7. Dealing with Difficulties Many people will begin to undereat in this case and will fail to gain the needed weight and muscle they were originally hoping for. But, because its an ageold and wellknown problem, it also has a few common solutions that you can be ready to deploy. Here are a few of the most helpful ones 1. Eat more calorically dense foods as you feel less hungry. This can be as simple as eating slightly fattier meats, mixing more oils into your carbohydrate sources, consuming white rice and white pasta instead of brown rice and wheat pastas, choosing less filling vegetables, choosing more grains versus fruits, etc. CALORIE CONTENT PER 100 GRAMS PROTEIN CARBOHYDRATES FATS Flax 534 kcal Quinoa 360 kcalRice 357 kcalBanana 89 kcalPotato 77 kcalMelon 36 kcalPumpkin 26 kcalWatercress 11kcalOlive Oil 884 kcalPecan 691 kcalPeanut Butter 598 kcal Cashew 553 kcal Cheddar Cheese 403 kcalAvocado 167 kcal8020 Beef 254 kcalChicken Thigh 197 kcalChicken Breast 173 kcal973 Beef 153 kcalTurkey Bacon 116 kcalWhole Milk Greek Yogurt 85kcalNonfat Greek Yogurt 59kcal MUSCLEGAIN DIETING MADE SIMPLE 29 7. Dealing with Difficulties 2. Eat more tasty foods as you feel less hungry. Often, supertasty foods are easier to eat in higher amounts, which is a good thing when youre trying to combat fullness. Consider using flavors, salt, and spices to make your goto musclegaining meals like rice and ground turkey taste a bit better. 3. Eat something when youre not hungry but have a meal planned. Skipping meals is a death knell when your goal is to gain weight. Liquid meals like mass gainer shakes are way better than not eating any thing at all. You can use them specifically during times when you know your hunger is bound to be low such as in the morning for many people. EXCESSIVE BODY FAT GAIN The final difficulty we want to address in this guide is excessive body fat gain. In almost every case, some fat gain will come along with muscle gain, and the good news is that fat is pretty easy to lose after the muscle gain phase is over. Thus, its probably best to think of fat gain as just a temporary and reversible cost of the musclegain process. But if youd like to stay on the leaner side of things, consider some of the following tips Aim for the lower end of the weekly weight gain pace. For example, aim to gain 0.25 of your body weight each week instead of 0.5. Aim for the lower end of the gain duration. For example, aim to gain for 812 weeks instead of. 1416 weeks. MUSCLEGAIN DIETING MADE SIMPLE 30 7. Dealing with Difficulties Eat mostly healthy foods and dont cheat too much. Its tough to complain about excess fat gain when a third of your meals are junk foodbased! Train hard and with higher volumes relative to your abilities. Stay physically active outside of the gym. This can be done very easily by getting a step tracker wristwatch and holding yourself accountable to somewhere between 8,00010,000 steps per day to start. Remind yourself that fat gain is temporary and that its relatively easy to lose the fat later. Think of it as just the cost of doing business. Sometimes you have to lose money to make money, which in this case would translate to gaining a bit of unwanted fat in order to get more jacked in the longrun. When applied properly, the tips here really can help you succeed with your musclegain phase. As you may have noticed, lots of people have gained some muscle temporarily, but far fewer keep that muscle on and then gain even more muscle on top of their initial muscle gain sprint. In the next section, well detail how you can solidify your gains and prepare your body for even more gains down the road. MUSCLEGAIN DIETING MADE SIMPLE 31 8. MAINTENANCE PHASES AND MINICUTS When youre done with your musclegain phase that lasts between eight and 16 weeks, youre inevitably going to be bigger and much more muscular, which is great! But, your bodys settling point systems are going to try to pull it back down to your previous weight and muscle size, which is decidedly not great and arguably even wildly depressing. Most people will succumb to at least some of this pull and lose a lot of muscle on the way down, but you wont be making that mistake. Why? Because youre going to read this section thoroughly to the extent that you understand how to prevent it. The key insight with regards to the prevention of muscle loss after a musclegain diet phase ends is that youre not actually done purposefully dieting yet. And this is where many people fall astray. In other words, stick to your diet foods, dont go offplan, and dont lose your diet momentum. Your hunger will be ultralow, so youll be tempted to get lazy with your eating, but stay strong! The good news is that you should cut about 50 of your surplus calories right away. For example, if you added a total of 600 calories above your baseline intake through all of the weeks of dieting, and went from 2,500 calories to 3,100 calories, you can drop 300 calories off right away and maintain an intake of 2, 800 calories. MUSCLEGAIN DIETING MADE SIMPLE 32 8. Maintenance Phases and Minicuts TIMECALORIES 250028003000 MAINTENANCESURPLUS The calories you ﬁnish your muscle gain diet on will usually be higher than those youll maintain that new size on, so be prepared to downwardadjust your peak calories at the end of muscle gain once you enter maintenance.FINDING NEW MAINTENANCE Youre bigger now, your metabolism is faster, and you simply need more food to maintain your new size, so no, you wont have to eat your surplus diet forever to maintain, but youll have to eat more than youre used to. In the first week of transitioning from your musclegain diet to your maintenance diet, you can expect to lose up to 2 of your weight from a reduction in body water alone. Dont let this freak you out, as its not muscle mass and it doesnt mean youre undereating. But, if you continue dropping weight over the second week, add in 250 calories and continue to add 250 calories weekly if your weight trends down. You will rarely have to do this more than once, but if it does happen, you can be prepared. MUSCLEGAIN DIETING MADE SIMPLE 33 8. Maintenance Phases and Minicuts Lastly, on a training note, you should reduce your training volume after youre done with your musclegain phase. Your training volume should be at about a third of your musclegain training volume for the next 24 weeks to give your body a break and let it resensitize to new muscle gains. You can also employ a twoweek active rest phase which just involves being active in leisure activity and perhaps not even going to the gym. During such a phase, you can temporarily lose another 2 of your body mass from body water reductions, but its important not to make any changes to your caloric intake as all of that body weight will come right back as soon as you start training again. Once your musclegain and maintenance phases have come to an end, a few things should be happening 1. You should be holding on to your newly gained muscle. 2. You should be healed up and ready to train. 3. You might be holding onto a bit of extra body fat. So what happens now? Getting rid of that extra fat will be more aesthetically pleasing and physically healthier for you before you start another phase of musclegain dieting. The phase youll do here is called a minicut, which is a short fat loss phase of usually 46 weeks in duration. During this phase, youll aim to alter your calories to lose between 0.5 to 1.25 of your body weight per week. The shorter the phase is, the more rapid the loss rate should be. During this phase, you should train at about two thirds of your usual training volume, which is just enough to keep the muscle you built in the last muscle gain phase but probably not enough to gain any more. This low volume is essential to keep you sensitive to volume and thus to muscle growth so that once the minicut is over, you can begin to work up to your normal volumes in a new musclegain phase. At this point, you simply repeat the entire process over again. MUSCLEGAIN DIETING MADE SIMPLE 34 9. LONGTERM MUSCLEGAIN By sequencing multiple phases of musclegain, maintenanceactive rest, and minicutting, you can gain lots of muscle over the longterm. JAN FEB MAR APR MAY JUN JUL AUG SEPT OCT NOV DECCALORIE BALANCE MAINTENANCE16 WEEK SURPLUS 6 WEEK MINICUT14 WEEK SURPLUS10 WEEK SURPLUS 6 WEEK MINICUT JAN FEB By alternating periods of caloric surplus with periods of deﬁcit, you can slowly add net muscle without adding fat over the course of a year of dedicated training and dieting.CALORIE BALANCE THROUGHOUT THE YEAR MUSCLEGAIN DIETING MADE SIMPLE 35 9. LongTerm MuscleGain But, to make sure youre getting the most out of your efforts, you want to make sure youre not trying to rush the process by attempting to gain more than about 0.5 of your body weight per week during musclegain phases. Its tempting, but gaining faster than you should will probably just make you significantly fatter for an unimpressive amount of extra musclegain. Additionally, you dont want to gain for much more than 16 weeks at a time as your body will tend to become very fatigued from that much unabated hard training, and your gains will slow to an underproductive grind as your injury rates may escalate and your motivation declines. And, as tempting as it may be to want to ignore them, youre going to want to commit to maintenanceactive rest and minicut phases because skipping them will reduce your ana bolic sensitivity to training, increase your injury risk, and allow your body fat to increase more than you might like. Now, thats obviously all of the stuff you shouldnt be doing. Here are some helpful tips for what you should be doing instead to make your longterm musclegain journey as productive as possible 1. Perform each of the gainmaintainminicut phases. Sometimes a longer cut will be required to renorm leanness if youre a bit fatter than you like, so prepare to diet at 0.51.0 rate for 810 weeks if needed or desired. Sometimes longer maintenance phases or active rest phases are needed when youre feeling extra fatigued or if life circumstances take you away from being able to commit to a musclegain or fat loss phase for a while. 2. Continue to experiment with exercises and routines that work best. Consider priority phases for muscle groups like training your chest and triceps more than usual and your back and biceps less than usual for a musclegain phase. Then, you can switch them around next time and repeat the process. Such priority phases can reinvigorate stale progress.

Expect for your rate of gain to slow down over time. TIMEMUSCLE GROWTHMUSCLE GROWTH POTENTIAL ADVANCED 7 YEARS INTERMEDIATE 37 YEARS BEGINNER 03 YEARSMUSCLE GROWTH POTENTIAL With every year of training, musclegain phases will net a bit less new muscle and a bit more body fat to burn off during minicutting. Thats just how the human body works. But, if you stick with it for years, the changes you can see in your physique can be nothing short of astounding. The people not discouraged by the disappearance of noob gain rates are the ones that make the most impressive longterm muscle gains. Everyone youve ever seen whos very muscular is a person who almost certainly kept going even after the early and easy gains slowed down, so give that some thought if thats where youd like your journey to go. MUSCLEGAIN DIETING MADE SIMPLE 37 9. LongTerm MuscleGain In short, be patient, be realistic, and remember that the biggest factor when it comes to successful longterm musclegain is time. The other one is, of course, consistency and hard training, which youll need in mass quantities if you want to get as big as possible. And, if you are one of the few who does want to get as big as possible, the next section is for you. MUSCLEGAIN DIETING MADE SIMPLE 38 10. GETTING EXOTICALLY HUGE Getting exotically huge is a fancy way of saying youd like to get to within 95 of your maximum genetic potential to put on muscle under nearly ideal circumstances. If thats something that interests you, here are some insights on it 1. Its not for everyone. Truthfully, theres really no good reason to get exotically huge beyond the artistic value of it. In other words, getting huge isnt guaranteed to fix any thing in your life, win you more attention from the opposite sex, or make you happier. And it certainly wont make all of your dreams come true. In fact, its only guaranteed to, well, get you huge! If you love the idea of get ting huge for its own sake, it can be an amazing experience, but if you think it will automatically lead to other benefits and advantages in life, dont be so sure. Getting enormous also comes with a host of negative health consequences simply due to the fact that gaining lots of weight is usually not healthy even if most of it is muscle. Thus, to really want to get as big as possible without using drugs, youll have to come to peace with the fact that youll be trading away a bit of your longterm health for muscle size. And if you do choose to use drugs, its a massive tradeoff you must be aware of. 2. It takes years to get super jacked. It takes about 10 years for most people to get even remotely close to their true potential, so if its something you think you can do in 23 years, think again. And, keep in mind that were talking about 10 consistent years of MUSCLEGAIN DIETING MADE SIMPLE 39 10. Getting Exotically Huge integrated diet and training that can often be uncomfortable to the extent that you experience several if not all of the symptoms we outlined in section seven. So, if youre admittedly not in love with the process of body building, you might sincerely consider spending your time doing a host of other wonderful hobbies available. Pretty much all other very physical activities interfere with optimal muscle gain, so if youre really into mountain biking or surfing or racquetball or anything like that, prepare to put those hobbies on hold or on a signifi cantly reduced frequency and intensity for a long time. For some, giving up everything to be as muscular as possible simply wont be worth it, which is why were always quick to mention the interference effect. If size is the ultimate goal, you should be aiming to move your body weight up slowly over time. This gets really hard as you continue to get bigger and bigger, so youll have to fight your bodys instincts to stay smaller and really become, as the trite saying goes, comfortable with being uncomfortable in the categories of both eating and training like a monster for years. 3. The final few years of gains will require nearly ideal circumstances. This includes getting plenty of sleep at all times. Going through phases of not sleeping well or not being able to prioritize your sleep will almost certainly prevent you from getting exotically huge. You will have to set up your life in a way that eliminates most if not all of your normal life stressors. The most obvious of these might be a physically demanding job like working in construction or even an incredibly stressful job in general like managing highrisk investment profiles or being an exec utive in a fastpaced, hectic work culture. Lastly, you cant be skipping meals and workouts. Consistent, smart training and eating can be a fun job at this point, but make no mistake! Its still a job, and that job needs to be taken seriously. 4. Finally, keep in mind that the biggest guys in the world Are on lots of drugs, and none of those are magical. Their lifestyles consist of more of the same consistent training and eating with the addition of the musclegain benefits of drugs. Note too that these drugs cause tons of side effects that will hamper your longevity, health, sexual function, and even your psychological wellbeing to varying but sometimes extreme extents. MUSCLEGAIN DIETING MADE SIMPLE 40 10. Getting Exotically Huge If you want to be the biggest you can be, its probably the wisest thing to do to get as muscular as possible without them, only committing to that switch under the following circumstances If they are legal in your country If youre not using them to cheat in competitive sports If you have a supervising coach and medical doctor Only after age 25 at the earliest Only after at least 810 years of training without any drugs No matter which way you decide to go, make sure youre always thinking things through, and remember to be diligent, consistent, patient, and to enjoy yourself regardless of how big your muscles are.

Tracking makes you more conscious what you consume and less likely to wander to the fridge and sneak a bite here and there those all add up! Try intermittent fasting if youve never tried it. My favorite way to go is a 8 hour eating window eg. eat all my calories between 12 8pm. Dont buy unhealthy foods youre going to feel guilty about eating. If its in your house, youre going to eat it. Do NOT bring food with you to the couch. Mindless eating is an easy way to pack on the pounds. For every Netflix show you watch, do 1 min of jumping jacks, pushups, run up and down the stairs, etc.1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7.

WHY MAKE THE EFFORT? Training is fun, and hard, heavy training is even more fun, so why would anyone ever want to ruin the mood by being concerned about injury risk? Injuries can happen to anyone, and some risk of injury is simply an inevitable part of playing the game. Injury risk mitigation, however, can require thought, effort, and calculated restraint, which can be annoying and even interfere with your ability to perform at your best. After all, choosing to implement such restraint versus simply training hard can actually cause less muscle and strength to be gained in the short term. So, if were going to bother with trying to prevent injuries, there had better be a rather compelling case for that effort, right? Fortunately, there is. MAKE THE EFFORT INJURY PREVENTION MADE SIMPLE 2 1. Why Make the Effort Here are seven basic reasons why it pays to put at least some effort into preventing injuries 1. Getting injured hurts! Pain stinks. Yes, some pain is inevitable when training hard, but avoiding unneces sary pain with minimal trade offs might be worthwhile. 2. Recovery interferes with your quality of life. If you get seriously hurt, you might have trouble walking around, getting into and out of cars, and doing plenty of other basic tasks you need to do in order to live your life. Injuries in the gym can make life outside of the gym cumbersome and frustrating for weeks, months, and even years, depending on the severity of the injury. 3. Hospital bills and medications cost you time, money, and work. When youre injured, you might have to seek medical care, which costs some combination of time, money, and possibly even missed work or school, which costs you even more time and money on the back end. 4. Injuries result in time away from your most productive training. When youre hurt, you probably wont be able to train as productively as possible, which can be both psychologically demoralizing and physically restrictive. In fact, many injuries can prevent you from training muscles or movements in the injured area in a way that stimulates any growth or improvement at all. And, in some cases, you might not even be able to train effectively enough to maintain your preinjury ability. This means you lose additional time even after your injury has healed in the attempt to reestablish how good you used to be before youre able to make new gains again. Severe enough injuries may even preclude effective training of that area for weeks, months, years, or even for good. INJURY PREVENTION MADE SIMPLE 3 1. Why Make the Effort 5. Getting injured right before a competition is always demoralizing. If you get hurt right before an important competition, it could take several months or even a year of training and flush it right down the drain. Imagine having your plane tickets, hotel, and registration bought and paid for and then getting hurt. For most competitive athletes, this would be incredibly demoralizing and financially deleterious. 6. You never want permanent deformation of your physique andor abilities. If you hurt your spine badly enough, you may never be able to train your legs and lower back heavy again. Sadly, it has happened to many people in the past. If you tear a pec, for example, the torn pec, even if reattached and functionally returned to normal after surgery, will likely always look deformed, which is obvi ously to no advantage to anyone competing in the sport of physique. Because of this, something about the chance of permanent loss of function or appearance should make even minimal considerations of injury prevention very appealing to most athletes who care about their futures. 7. Any injury increases injury risk in that area for the rest of your career. Injuries would not be such a bad thing if you got hurt once, healed properly, and were never subjected to reinjuring that same area in the future. However, in many cases, having hurt an area once makes it more likely that youll hurt the same area again in the future. This seems to apply especially to previ ously torn muscles, as the scar tissue that heals the area might not be as strong and integrated as the muscle it replaced. Thus, if you get hurt once in an area, youre potentially setting yourself up for future increased risk in that same area. Whats the best way to avoid that? You guessed it! Minimize your chances of getting hurt to begin with. INJURY PREVENTION MADE SIMPLE 4 1. Why Make the Effort With all that being said, even if youre willing to pay the price of a higher injury risk in order to push faster progress, the biggest downside of taking on that risk is that injuries hurt progress itself the most. At the end of the day, that may be the most compelling reason to try to minimize the chances of getting hurt. Why? Because it makes you the opposite of better and interferes with your journey to become the best version of yourself you can be. So, instead of training hard and simply letting the chips fall where they may, youre probably best served by training hard while still taking all of the logical precautions against injury. As a bit of a final note, youd be wise to avoid needlessly elevating injury risk so that you can get as good at your chosen sport or hobby as you can. Although this specific resource may appeal mostly to bodybuilding and physique enthusiasts, CrossFitters and other skill sport enthusiasts may find injuries particularly detrimental as well in that they detract from any momentum built in their development of crucial skills to excel in their craft. And all of that begins with proper technique, which is our next point of consideration. INJURY PREVENTION MADE SIMPLE 5 2. 7 FUNDAMENTALS OF SAFE LIFTING TECHNIQUE In some sense, what is considered a safe lifting technique is subjective and individualized. Safe is, of course, a relative term, and most techniques are somewhere between com pletely safe and completely reckless yet rarely at either of those extremes themselves. Moreover, what may be safe for a person with no history of knee injuries might be very risky for someone with an extensive knee injury history, so there is certainly much to be said for nuancing our interpretations of safe lifting technique from situation to situation. Lastly, there are definitely times when techniques that are usually safe in one context are either needless or unsafe in another. However, for most people in most cases, a few basic technique fundamentals in the gym can go a long way toward reducing injury risk when they are appropriately applied. If you practice them, ingrain them, and remain consistent with them over time, your injury risk will be notably and impactfully lower than if you were to behave otherwise. Now, lets look at the seven technique fundamentals for injury risk reduction INJURY PREVENTION MADE SIMPLE 6 2. 7 Fundamentals of Safe Lifting Technique 1. DOING FULL AND STANDARDIZED ROM Doing the full range of motion ROM of a lift reduces the external load you have to use in order to get the same stimulus. For example, if you squat halfway down for sets of 10, you might need 400 pounds for a similar muscle growth stimulus that youd get with only 250 pounds squatted all the way down for the same 10 reps. Because of the lightened external load, any instabilities that throw you off of your best path can be corrected without having to fight the momentum of much heavier weight, which reduces injury risk. As a bonus, using a full and standardized range of motion also reduces the long term wear and tear of heavy lifting. 2. USING CONTROLLED ECCENTRICS Some of the highest forces seen in lifting come from the amortization phase, which is the part of the lift when the descent eccentric flips quickly into the ascent concentric, such as when you touch the bar to your chest in a bench press and come back up. With any given load, the faster the amortization phase is, the higher the peak forces and chances for injury will be. In addition, if you rush the eccentric portion of the movement, you actually miss out on some of the muscle growth gains that can come from controlling it. Because of this, its best to control the eccentric by reducing its speed substantially from what gravity would do without opposition so that you can both reduce the risk of injury and get more gains. For very heavy lifts in anatomically compromising positions such as heavy bench presses or weighted pull ups, taking a quick pause at the bottom of each rep might be helpful as well. INJURY PREVENTION MADE SIMPLE 7 2. 7 Fundamentals of Safe Lifting Technique While you dont have to use these practices, I will say this on a per sonal note Ive both hurt myself many times and seen other people hurt many times, but Ive never, not once, seen anyone get hurt during a slowly controlled eccentric with a pause with any amount of weight above the 5RM range. In other words, if you control your eccentrics and pause on most of your lifts, there is a good chance your injury risk will decline substantially. 3. CONTROLLING MOMENTUM AT MOVEMENT ENDRANGES A big factor in promoting lifting safety is to be in control of the lifting implement at all times. If you lose control and let gravity and momentum take over, reasserting that control may be a bit risky. For example, if you do shoulder presses by throwing the bar up and over your head without slowing down much at the end, youre likely at a higher chance of elbow or shoulder injury if the bar leaves your hands for a bit and comes back down at an awkward angle. Thus, it likely pays to stay in control of the weight at all times, even if youre feeling very fired up, by making sure to slow the weight down at the top of the movement so as to minimize the snap and reacceptance of the weight. You can think of this advice as the opposite of throwing weight around. INJURY PREVENTION MADE SIMPLE 8 2. 7 Fundamentals of Safe Lifting Technique 4. NOT CHEATING Cheating involves the use of nontargeted muscles to generate extra momentum to complete a repetition. Extra momentum is itself an increased injury risk, but cheating also risks injury in two other ways. Firstly, by definition it allowsrequires you to use more weight than usual, and the higher the load, the more likely the chance of injury. Secondly, cheating can rely on other muscles to push the movement beyond the capabil ities of the target muscles, which puts the target muscles at higher risk for injury. For example, if you cheat curl a weight up that you could not have curled without cheating, on the way back down, youll probably try to control the weight at least to some degree. Now, that control might come from the biceps, but all of a sudden the biceps are being asked to control a weight that they were not strong enough to lift in the first place. As you might imagine, this is not ideal when the goal is sustainable, injuryfree lifting technique. 5. AVOIDING REPEATEDLY PAINFUL POSITIONS If you are experiencing sharp, localized pain, consider rethinking the exercise, technique, loading, or other variables. This is especially applicable if the pain increases as you do more reps and sets or across training sessions. INJURY PREVENTION MADE SIMPLE 9 2. 7 Fundamentals of Safe Lifting Technique For example, if your pec tendon on the right side begins to feel agitated on the eleventh rep of a 12rep rep set, its probably fine to finish the set and complete all 12 reps. After a bit of stretching in between sets and a few slow, controlled reps on the next set to ensure nothing is becoming increasingly uncomfortable, youll probably never feel it again and not need to make any adjustments. Most incidents of pain in the gym are either desired such as the metabolite burn sen sation in fatigued muscles that actually contributes to growth, for example or just weird oneoff instances that arent indicative of any actual injury. However, if on your second set the pain returns on rep five and gets progressively worse with each following rep, its probably wisest to stop and reassess. Similarly, if the pain was tolerable in your first week of training but has advanced to extreme levels of discomfort by your third week of training, definitely dont just keep going! Stop, change exercises, reduce the load, or even avoid training that area for a few days. If that doesnt start to make things a bit better, consider seeing a medical professional. 6. AVOIDING UNSTABLE MOVES WITH HEAVY LOADS Sometimes, the combination of instability and heavy loading can be a formula for injury. For example, if youre squatting onto your toes like a sissy squat vari ation, standing on a BOSU ball under heavy loads, or even doing less than your 8RM on dumbbell presses, youre introducing instability into heavy training, and even the smallest deviation can lead to an injury. INJURY PREVENTION MADE SIMPLE 10 2. 7 Fundamentals of Safe Lifting Technique Obviously, sets of 15 in the sissy squat are profoundly safe, and sets of 10 in the dumb bell press are as well, but if you choose to go very heavy, especially closer to sets of five, stable bars, machines, and foot placements are likely the way to go. 7. BEING AWARE OF GENERALLY QUESTIONABLE POSITIONS The human body is incredibly resilient and adaptable, but some of our joints and struc tures are not designed for heavier loading in certain positions. This may include deadlifting very heavy with a very rounded back, very dynamic, high load shoulder joint moves like the snatch lift in weightlifting, or any movement that involves twisting and turning under heavy loads. That being said, these are not necessarily dangerous movements in an absolute sense. Practicing them with lighter loads on up makes them substantially safer than if you just tried them out randomly with no practice. But, they are likely at least marginally more risky than their alternatives, which in this case would be deadlifting with a flat back, nonexplosive shoulder movements, and nontwist ing lifts. This is just something to keep in mind as you navigate your own personal risk tolerances in the gym. Are deviations from these safety fundamentals always unwise? Not at all. However, if you do make deviations, they had better be wellreasoned ones, such as, I dont have any discomfort in this movement and Ive slowly built up the loading over weeks, and not immature, egodriven ones like, Woo! Lets get this weight! YOLO! With this basic understanding of how to avoid generally questionable positions, youll be set up well to minimize your risk of injury in the weight room. INJURY PREVENTION MADE SIMPLE 11 3. WARMING UP As you may have guessed, performing a proper warm up routine before any training session is an excellent way to help mitigate injury risk. But, other than the unconvincing mumblings of your 7th grade gym class teacher, why do you need to warm up? First, warming up allows you to physically warm up the tissues involved in the upcoming exercises. Warm tissues are literally less likely to snap than tissues that are physically colder. Additionally, warming up allows you to practice the first few exercises in your training program. Not only does this potentiate improved performance on the working sets to come, but it also gives you the kind of practice with lighter loads that increases the chances of a proper, stable technique once you progress toward heavier loads. Having good and stable technique at heavier loads drastically reduces your injury risk. In summary, warming up improves your upcoming performance and decreases injury risk, which makes it a nobrainer for any serious or recreational lifter. INJURY PREVENTION MADE SIMPLE 12 3. Warming Up HOW TO WARM UP IN 3 SIMPLE STEPS STEP 1 Start with higher reps and light weight after a general cardio warm up. A general cardio warm up is optional, which might be 1015 minutes of something like incline walking or the Elliptical machine at a heart rate of 110130 bpm. Once your general cardio warm up is complete, perform a set of 1015 reps with your 4050RM or so on the exercise youre going to be doing first. For all warm up sets after this, rest between 30 seconds and one minute between each set. STEP 2 Work up incrementally as you increase the load and reduce the reps. From here, weve given you specific recommendations for incremental increases in weights based on how much weight you will be using for your working sets. WEIGHT LBSREPSWARMUP PROGRESSIONS INJURY PREVENTION MADE SIMPLE 13 3. Warming Up 0100 lbs Perform at least two warm ups total. For example, do 45 pounds for a set of 10, then 75 pounds for a set of 5, then go to 95 pounds for your first working set 100300 lbs Perform at least 3 warm ups total. For example, do 45 pounds for a set of 15, 135 pounds for a set of 10, 225 pounds for a set of 5, then go to 275 pounds for your first working set. 300500 lbs Perform at least 4 warm ups total. For example, do 45 pounds for a set of 15, 135 pounds for a set of 10, 225 pounds for a set of 8, 315 pounds for a set of 5, 405 pounds for a set of 3, then go to 425 pounds for your first working set. 500 lbs Perform as many warm up sets as needed following these same principles. STEP 3 Do an optional potentiation set with your working weight. Practically speaking, this load can be either your working weight or even 10 over it. Perform 14 repetitions, rest, and then begin your working sets. Doing a potentiation set can fire up your nervous system even more and get you practice with very heavy loads so youre not shocked by them during a working set to the extent that you risk unstable technique. Potentiation sets can be used in any context, but are especially helpful in heavier lifting. Once youve accounted for all three of these steps, youre ready to do your first working set. And to be clear, this is for the first exercise in a given workout session. For exercises that come second, third, and so on, fewer warm up sets may be required as you will both be generally warmer all around at this point and have probably warmed up the muscles youre about to use in prior exercises. If the muscles youre going to use in later exercise are not the same ones you used in ear lier exercises, consider implementing a full warm up for them as well, or at the very least a 10 rep warm up set and one 14 rep potentiation set before beginning your working sets. INJURY PREVENTION MADE SIMPLE 14 3. Warming Up ADDRESSING THE BOREDOM OF WARMING UP Warming up is extremely important, but lets be real It can seem very boring at times! Because of this, many people will often skip or rush their warmups. And unfortunately, skipping or rushing your warm ups is likely a major contributor to increased injury risk. If you rush or skip anything at the gym, the warm up may be the worst choice. Rushing warm ups is an especially bad idea if youre in a mental rush, under stress, if youre at a new gym with new equipment, training while traveling abroad, functioning on limited sleep, or under high fatigue. Those are the times in which you would benefit most by extending your warmup, not curtailing it. The best advice here is this dont skip your warm ups, and on the days you feel like doing them less, do them more! As difficult as that advice may be to implement in practice, its undoubtedly one of the hallmark characteristics of most mature, seasoned, and injuryfree lifters. INJURY PREVENTION MADE SIMPLE 15 4. LOAD MANAGEMENT Now you are warmed up and ready to go. Lets address the question of how heavy you should be lifting if injury risk is something youre keeping an eye on. In the simplest of phrasing, you should never lift heavier than is needed to get the job done. How heavy is that? Well, that depends on the job! Good technique needs to be replicable from rep to rep, set t o set, and session to session so that you can track progress, plan weightrep increases, be mindful of fatigue, and stay safe from injury.LOAD SELECTION FOR OPTIMAL TECHNIQUE WEIGHTTECHNIQUE QUALITYOPTIMAL TECHNIQUE TO WEIGHT RATIO TOO LIGHT TOO HEAVY INJURY PREVENTION MADE SIMPLE 16 4. Load Management If youre training for muscle growth, sets of 530 reps are best, so that rules out most instances of going heavier than your 5RM if size is the goal. If youre looking to improve your overall strength, sets of 36 reps are recommended. But again, no maxing out is needed. If youre looking to peak to show off your topend strength, then sets of 13 reps are fine and, in fact, very beneficial. But if youre avoiding heavy singles out of fear, you can probably relax and just be safe when you need to do them. If youre training for size or basic strength and youre doing singles all the time, youre taking needless injury risks and arguably wasting your time performing sets that could be done for more reps at lighter loads, leading to greater gains. PROGRESSING YOUR LOAD You dont get bigger and stronger by lifting the same weights repeatedly, so youll have to increase load over time. TIMEPERFORMANCEFITNESS LEVELFOR MANAGING INJURY RISKPROGRESSIVE OVERLOAD INJURY PREVENTION MADE SIMPLE 17 4. Load Management At every timescale, increasing load on the slower end of things will reduce your injury risk. If you can do an extra warm up set and thus increase weights from one warmup set to the other a bit more smoothly, your injury risk will inevitably decline. If you can add 5 pounds to the bar every week during your accumulation training in a mesocycle, youll be a bit safer than if you tried to add 10 pounds or 15 pounds every week. If you jump by 25 pounds in load from the end of your 510 rep range hypertrophy phase to the beginning of your 36 rep range strength phase, youll be a bit safer than if you went up by 50 pounds. Does this mean that the slower you warm up, the better? No way! Too many warm ups take too much time and can elicit diminishing returns or even nega tive returns if you get so tired doing warm ups that your working sets go poorly. The key is to understand the dynamics at play and that, if youre feeling a bit tired or achy or unstable, warming up slower or adding 10 pounds to the bar versus 15 pounds from last week might be something to think about. Strength and size take years to increase, so theres no universe in which you wont get as strong as you could have because you chose to add 5 pounds to the bar instead of 10 pounds. That is very important to remember in the context of keeping your poise and adding weight modestly and intelligently versus recklessly over time. In the end, its probably wise to almost never just throw some weight on the bar with out it being justified for your specific goals, without having worked up to it gradually over weeks and months, and without having performed a proper warm up. INJURY PREVENTION MADE SIMPLE 18 5. VOLUME MANAGEMENT In study after study, two of some of the biggest predictors of injury risk have shown to be, first, the rapid escalation of volume from a low to a very high level, and second, consistent, unabated periods of unsustainably high volumes of training. With that insight, lets see how you can make sure your training program keeps you on the low end of injury risk with three simple rules 3 SIMPLE RULES FOR VOLUME MANAGEMENT RULE 1 When choosing starting volumes, start very low. Whatever gives you a small pump for hypertrophy or a bit of a challenge for strength work is a good place to start in a program. For example, this means that in week one of your plan, 23 sets per muscle or movement type per session is a good start in most cases. No, it wont annihilate you, but thats the whole point. Doing too much volume upfront risks injury, and since gains are made over weeks of slow and steady progression anyway, doing too much upfront really doesnt have any notable benefit. Its just something people do because they feel fresh and are excited to make gains. INJURY PREVENTION MADE SIMPLE 19 5. Volume Management Of course, its tempting to do a ton of volume right away, but because your body is so sensitive to training at the beginning of a program anyway, doing a lot of volume right away is needless at best and risky at worst. Remember that your minimum effective volume MEV is often much lower than you might think, so going easy at first is a very good idea in most cases. TRAINING VOLUMEFATIGUEFatigue increases exponentially with training volumeRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN VOLUME AND FATIGUE INJURY PREVENTION MADE SIMPLE 20 5. Volume Management RULE 2 When increasing volume, do so slowly. If youre recovering well and feeling challenged far below your abilities, add only 12 sets per muscle or movement per session. Often the addition of just one set per muscle or movement per session can do the trick. If you start adding three or more sets to each workout every single week, the rapid esca lation in volume will accumulate so much fatigue that your risk for injury will skyrocket. RULE 3 Never exceed your maximum recoverable volume MRV for more than a week. Training beyond your ability to recover sounds exactly like it reads nonsensical. To be fair, it is possible that as much as a week of training beyond your maximum recov erable volume MRV can have delayed benefits the week after. But, If youre fatigued so much that your strength plateaus or even decreases for a week straight, reduce the volume significantly by beginning a recovery phase of some kind, usually a deload. Training over your MRV for longer than a week at most is likely to result not only in highly increased injury risks but also in much less, zero, or even negative muscle growth otherwise known as muscle loss. Training hard until you cant train harder is admirable and will result in you getting your best gains, but you dont get any bonus points for pushing it beyond your recovery abilities for any meaningful amount of time. Your best bet in all of this is to have a plan, and its probably unwise for that plan to be something to the tune of, Just grind it, bro! Set after set. Get these gains! Volume levels and progressions need to be justified by your goals instead of your emo tions, your insession music, or the fact that your preworkout just kicked in. Volume should be added slowly with high volumes requiring a gradual leadin over weeks, not days. Lastly, you should be able to measure and roughly estimate your MRV, so that youre not accidentally training beyond your own abilities to recover while needlessly spinning your wheels and exposing yourself to higher injury risks. Never just grind set after set into oblivion. INJURY PREVENTION MADE SIMPLE 21 6. DETECTING AND REDUCING FATIGUE As you train hard for weeks in succession, predictable things happen to your body. Your muscles get small tears in them, and not all of those tears heal up weekonweek. Your connective tissues like your tendons also get the same types of small tears and, because of a much more limited blood supply than your muscles have access to, heal even more slowly and sum up even more damage as the weeks go by. Your nervous system begins to fatigue and leads you to become less coordinated. This lowered coordination ability usually occurs days or weeks before your fatigue becomes high enough to reduce your strength output ability. Thus, by the time youve hit your MRV and your strength has fallen, youre already less coordinated than usual and more prone to a technique misstep or blunder that could injure you. Because fatigue is cumulative, all of these effects add up week after week, which can eventually reduce and even eliminate your gains if unchecked. Its not rocket science to infer that, if your muscles and tendons are more frayed than ever, an increased chance of technical error from the lower levels of coordination can lead to exposing weak tissue to lots of loading and thus increase the injury risk. In order to be able to prevent fatigue from climbing too high, you need reliable methods for detecting and estimating your varying states of fatigue. INJURY PREVENTION MADE SIMPLE 22 6. Detecting and Reducing Fatigue Once youve incorporated those methods, its important to hold yourself accountable for responding to the results of those methods once you find that your fatigue is, in fact, too high. There are at least five telltale signs that your fatigue is high enough to require a major reduction back to baseline. No single one of the five by itself indicates that fatigue is too high, but the more of these you experience at the same time, the higher the likelihood of excessive fatigue and the more reason to begin measures to bring it down as soon as possible. 5 SIGNS OF UNSUSTAINABLY HIGH FATIGUE SIGN 1 Reduced desire to train SIGN 2 Soreness that never really fully heals between workouts for the same muscle group each week SIGN 3 Feelings of anxiety and being overwhelmed by training and life, especially if youre looking at workouts before doing them and thinking, Im never going to be able to do this, to a greater degree than usual. SIGN 4 Appetite and sleep disruption, which usually present themselves as a reduced appetite and a tendency to have more restless sleep from which you wake too early in the morning and are unable to fall back asleep after. SIGN 5 A stall and decline in performance, usually one that affects all exercises for a muscle group or even all exercises for the entire body. This is especially relevant if such performance reduction lasts for a whole week and isnt just a oneoff bad workout. INJURY PREVENTION MADE SIMPLE 23 6. Detecting and Reducing Fatigue CRITERIA FOR HEALTHY SNACKIN G SIGN S OF UNS USTAIN ABLY HIGH FATIGUE LOW DESIRE TO TRAIN STUBBORN SORENESS ANXIOUS, OVERWHELMED, CATASTROPHIC MINDSET APPETITE AND SLEEP DISRUPTION A STALL AND DECLINE IN PERFORMANCE If youre experiencing several of the above signs, its probably time to reduce your fatigue. If just one of your muscles is underperforming compared to baseline for a week straight but your other muscles are fine and youre not experiencing any symptoms of systemic fatigue such as disrupted appetite and sleep, a recovery session or several may be in order. A recovery session is essentially just your normal session for that muscle group per formed at about half of the sets, load, and maybe even reps as usual. INJURY PREVENTION MADE SIMPLE 24 6. Detecting and Reducing Fatigue This very easy training lets you do just enough work to actively help the muscle recover kind of how physical therapy supplements the recovery of injured muscles while not doing so much work as to prevent fatigue from dissipating. If the muscle in question is really fatigued , you can take half a week of recovery, which just replaces a whole half of a week of regular workouts for a muscle or movement with recovery workouts to really drop some serious fatigue. IMPLEMENTING DELOAD PROTOCOLS If your highfatigue state includes definite systemic signs like appetite and sleep dis ruptions, desire to train reductions and anxiety increases, you need to drop way more fatigue than a single recovery session or halfweek can help with. In this case, you need an entire week of recovery sessions, which is known as a deload week . There are many valid ways to deload depending on the situation, but a great deload formula is to perform a recovery halfweek in the first part of a deload and then take the rest of the week completely off of training. Lastly, once or twice per year, especially if youre training very hard at a very high level, a deload might not be enough to bring down all of the residual fatigue accumulated over months of hard training. In such cases, an active rest phase of about two weeks may be warranted. Such a phase can consist of a deload week followed by a week completely away from the gym in which you do lots of eating, resting, and relaxing, with any physical activity being leisurely in nature. Nothing in this world zaps cumulative fatigue like an active rest phase. If youre super fatigued and dont think a mere week of deloading will cut it, try an active rest phase, but remember to come back after with super low volumes so that you can keep injury risk low for your entire training sequence. INJURY PREVENTION MADE SIMPLE 25 7. WHEN PAIN MEANS STOP Pain in the gym can mean one of generally three things. First, it can be mostly or wholly neurogenic in nature. Neurogenic pain can occur for lots of reasons, but its core feature is that its just a misfiring of the nervous system as if injury had occurred even though nothing is actually injured. For example, when you squat down in your warm ups and get a shooting pain in your hips, you probably didnt break your femur, and the next rep will likely feel completely fine. Second, pain can indicate that stretching or metabolic triggers are being activated. And, because we both expect and want this to happen during training, its nothing to be concerned about. If you do a set of chest flyes and your pecs feel painfully stretched at the bottom of each rep, you can expect this pain to bring growth instead of injury. Or, if you do a set of 20 leg presses, your quads might hurt so much that you roll out of the machine in agony as you try to massage the pain out in desperation. Because this quad pain comes from the very same metabolite accretion that causes muscle growth and mechanis tically cannot actually injure you, youre completely fine. Deal with it, and keep going! INJURY PREVENTION MADE SIMPLE 26 7. When Pain Means Stop The last possible category of pain is pain that properly detects that an injury has occurred. The obvious question becomes this How can you tell this final, importantly different kind of pain apart from the others? While there is no certain method, there are at least three indications that can give you some insight. INDICATION 1 The pain is in a small, specific area. Usually, this occurs at the tendon or inaround the joint, not in the belly of a muscle. For example, if youre doing an overhead press and you perceive extreme discomfort in a very specific place in your elbow after the set, this might be a good indication of true injury. At the same time, whole muscle burning is almost never an injury. There are very few injuries that make the entire muscle hurt at the same time. INDICATION 2 The pain comes on suddenly. Many of us know this feeling. The classic example is being in the middle of an exercise when all of a sudden you hear some sort of pop or click. Or you might even experience a sudden loss of strength as a muscle or tendon seems to give out. Gradual pain onset can mean something, but thats usually detectable via the third indi cation in our list. INDICATION 3 The pain gets worse with each rep, set, or session. If pain hits but then the next rep or set or session feels notably better, youre probably going to be just fine. But if it gets worse over time, its likely something to look into. If you feel pain during your workout and its not terrible, go ahead and test the waters by doing a few more reps, perhaps considering some pauses at the bottom to see if it helps. If the pain stays constant during the set, finish the set or discontinue the set early if the pain is extreme, honor your normal rest time, and try another set if it seems appropriate according to your best judgment. INJURY PREVENTION MADE SIMPLE 27 7. When Pain Means Stop If the pain improves in that second set from rep to rep, youre likely safe to continue on since youre probably not hurt. On the other hand, if additional work makes the pain worse, stop. Try to alter the technique or body positioning you use on the next set if its just a bit of pain. Sometimes just finding a comfier technique eliminates pain completely. If the pain is quite bad, try reducing the load youre using, slowing down the reps a lot, changing exercises for that muscle group for that session, or some combination of those. Next time you come back to the gym to train that movement or muscle group, try to warm up and do the workout as if nothing is wrong. If that still hurts and hurts pretty bad, keep the alternative exercises, techniques, cadences, or loadings that allowed you to train painfree during the prior session. Ease back into your normal efforts, and, after a deload, try that same original movement again. If this still hurts, now is the time to avoid that movement for a few months. And, if most or all movements involving that hurt area are very painful, its time to see a medical professional in most cases so that you can get a proper diagnosis. This last recourse is very, very rare since most incidents of pain in the gym arent anything a slight change in technique or a bit of persistence through another rep or set cant handle. INJURY PREVENTION MADE SIMPLE 28 8. DONT DO DUMB SHT! Sometimes getting hurt is just something that happens despite your best efforts to abide by rational, injuryreducing protocols. That being said, much of the time in the real world, most people will do at least one thing to needlessly increase their chances of injury. Often, its several things at the same time. And, for lack of a more sympathetic way to put it, these people simply have it coming. If you play with fire time and time again, eventually you will get burned. So if youd rather not be that person, heres a noninclusive list of dumb sht to avoid doing. Fortunately, most of these things appeal to common sense. The NonInclusive List of Dumb Sht to Avoid 1. Rushing or skipping warmups 2. Altering your technique to grind out another rep 3. Maxing out at random 4. Accepting a gym challenge for max strength or reps without training for it 5. Trying to keep up with a training partners loadrepssets at the expense of proper technique 6. Doing fuckery lifts like a random muscleup for no reason 7. Physical stupidity outside of the gym 8.

Dont Do Dumb Sht Having said all of this, youre an adult, so youre more than capable of making your own choices. Its always heartbreaking when you take all of the proper precautions and still get hurt, but the silver lining is that its difficult to get upset at anything other than what we might consider the grand architecture of the universe. On the other hand, if you get hurt doing dumb sht, you have an opportunity to learn from that experience and not repeat the same mistake in the future. But whether your injury was a product of foolishness or not, its important to understand how to recover properly so that you can get back to training at the fullest capacity possible. INJURY PREVENTION MADE SIMPLE 30 9. THE POSTINJURY COMEBACK With all of the tips and strategies weve mentioned so far, you can do much better than average in how often or how severely you get hurt. But, chances are, you will still get hurt at some point. So when you do, what do you do about it? After the injury occurs, stop training your injured body part immediately. If its a really bad injury, seek medical attention and follow all advice from the medical professionals in the categories of surgery, physical therapy, and everything else. At some point, youll likely be medically cleared to train. Unfortunately, this is precisely the moment in which the mystery begins since so few sources talk about exactly how to get back into normal training. Sure, we all understand that easing in is probably a good idea, but we can provide more specificity than that. In fact, weve put together the following sixphase guide with clarifying descriptions to help you navigate your return to training injuryfree. INJURY PREVENTION MADE SIMPLE 31 9. The PostInjury Comeback 6 PHASES FOR NAVIGATING YOUR POSTINJURY COMEBACK PHASE S FOR NA VIGAT ING YOUR POS T INJURY COMEBA CK THE ROM PHASELoads at 2530RM Expand ROM 5 RIR 13 sets, 36xwk THE REPS PHASELoads at 2030RM Slowly Escalate Above 34RIR BFR Training? 13 sets, 24xwk THE SETS PHASELoads at 2030RM 30 RIR If recovered, add sets THE LOAD PHASELoads at 1020RM When appropriate, load to 510RM 30 RIR THE CAUTIOUS NORMAL TRAINING PHASEReturn to previously injurious movements Ease into warmups Emphasis on technique, slow eccentrics, stability, and control RESUME NORMAL TRAINING INJURY PREVENTION MADE SIMPLE 32 9. The PostInjury Comeback PHASE 1 The ROM Phase Choose an exercises for the injured areas and begin to train. Train with super light loads that reflect your 2530RM. Focus on expanding your range of motion ROM with minimal or no pain. Keep five or more reps in reserve RIR on all sets. Focus on 13 sets of this type of work for 36 sessions per week. Once this protocol feels completely fine, begin the next phase. Be warned, how ever, that this phase can take days, weeks, or even months depending on the severity of the injury. The key is to be honest about the true pace of your recovery without rushing the process. PHASE 2 The Reps Phase In this phase, you can start doing sets that reflect your 2030RM. At this point, you can begin working towards 0 RIR from a conservative 34 RIR. Consider occlusion training in this phase if possible. Limit your sets to 13 per session with 24 sessions a week even if you feel great. Once that feels completely fine, you can move onto the next phase. PHASE 3 The Sets Phase Keep doing sets that reflect your 2030RM. Cycle from 3 RIR to 0 RIR over the period of several weeks in most cases. If youre recovering easily from session to session, consider adding sets to some of the sessions at the rate of no more than one set per session at a time. You might end up training 24 times per week with 38 sets per session by the end of this phase. Once that feels completely fine, you can move onto the next phase. PHASE 4 The Load Phase Slowly add load as you move into the 1020 rep range. If that feels doable, work all the way down to 510 reps if thats how you typically train that muscle or movement. INJURY PREVENTION MADE SIMPLE 33 9. The PostInjury Comeback During this phase, you should train exclusively between 3 and 0 RIR. Consider pauses and slow eccentrics at first to further minimize risk of reinjury. Once that feels completely fine, you can move onto the next phase. PHASE 5 The Cautious Normal Training Phase This is the time to resume normal training with a few disclaimers. For example, you should now feel free to incorporate normal exercises including the exercise or movement that may have injured you in the first place. Ease into warm ups and heavier loads with an added focus on stability and technique. Focus on pauses and slower eccentrics more than usual. Always be aware of the formerly injured area while training. Once that feels completely fine, you can move onto the next phase. PHASE 6 Normal Training Restarts Resume normal training completely. Depending on the injury, however, this might take Forever like full pec tear More than a year like a reattached triceps tendon rupture A few months like damaged knee cartilage A few weeks like a strained quad A few days like a tweaked glute Due diligence to these phases is important for severe injuries that take months to heal from, but you can shorten this process for very small injuries if needed. For example, if you tweak your calf during a session, you can dedicate the following session to moving through as many of these phases as possible. In other words, your first few warm up sets can serve as the entire ROM Phase, and, if things feel excellent, you can do another set at 5 RIR for about 20 reps as your entire Reps Phase. INJURY PREVENTION MADE SIMPLE 34 9. The PostInjury Comeback If that feels amazing, you can do another set of 30 reps with the same load, this time going very close to failure, which is your whole Sets Phase. Do you notice the pattern? Moving through those three phases in a single session is more than sufficient for any insignificant injury, so, at that point, you would be best to go home, rest, and come back to train your calves again three days later. This time, you warm up and then, with each progressive working set, you increase the load by 20 pounds until you hit a 10RM weight with no symptoms at all on the last set of the session. This would check off your completion of the Load Phase. The next session after, you do the Cautious Normal Training Phase, take a recovery session for calves the session after that, and then begin the Normal Training Phase right after. In this case, just two weeks of modified training could account for completion of all six of our recommended phases. In the real world, some injuries really will just take two weeks to get over while others may take two months or even two years when its all said and done. What matters most is that you stay true to this progression. Similarly, dont rush the process, skip phases, or do them out of order. If at the end of each phase you feel totally fine, its completely appropriate to move onto the next phase, but if youre not honest with yourself, you will be the only person that pays the price. In summary, as it pertains to all things injuryrelated, let your body inform you when youre ready, not your ego. And, if youre ever unsure about the pace of your recovery, err on the side of a slower return. Nothing about a conservative recovery process should ever be considered soft or weak. In fact, there is much wisdom in listening to your body, incorporating a sensible INJURY PREVENTION MADE SIMPLE 35 9. The PostInjury Comeback recovery protocol, and autoregulating the pace of that recovery protocol in order to potentiate even better performance outcomes once youre fully healed. And thats it, folks!

HOW DO YOU CHOOSE EXERCISES? When youre training with weights at the gym, how can you know for sure that youre really stimulating your muscles to grow? Acutely, signs of a robust, musclegrowing stimulus usually include some perceived ten sion in the target muscle. This experience might feel as though something in there is either under great strain or potentially even ripping apart ever so slowly, especially when you train heavier for lower reps. A growth stimulus can also present itself as a burning sensation in the target muscle, especially if youre training for higher reps and going close to muscular failure. After each set and especially after a few sets, growthstimulated muscles will often also feel super pumped and seemingly full of fluid as well as very fatigued and difficult to move in normal ways. In the hours and days after effective training, the target muscle might also feel tight and even a bit sore. In the longer term, muscle growth is best proxied by your repetition strength. So, if you can use the same weight for more and more reps over time or use an increasingly heavier weight for similar reps over time, this is a very good indication that youre probably gaining muscle. Now that you know which experiences correlate with probable muscle growth, you can choose the exercises youd like to use for any given target muscle youre interested in growing by looking for those very same signs of growth. The exercises that check the boxes of these growth correlates, or proxies as we might refer to them later, are probably your best bets for growth. HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 2 1. How do you choose exercises If growth is the goal, you should choose exercises that 1. Cause tension andor a burning sensation in the target muscles. 2. Give you the best pumps. 3. Zap energy from your target muscles the best. 4. Stress your joints the least. 5. Do all of the aforementioned things without needless exertion or systemic fatigue. That is, if you train the muscle hard, but youre not as allaround tired as you would be from other similar exercise choices, youre probably on the right track to choosing the best exercises possible for hypertrophy. HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 3 1. How do you choose exercises In essence, youre looking for the exercises that give you the most musclegrowth stimu lus yet cost you and your body the least amount of fatigue possible. That is truly the ideal combination for hypertrophy as we consider exercise selection. However, this doesnt mean that zero fatigue at all is best, it just means that if youre going to choose a significantly fatiguing exercise, it had better be delivering a massive stimulus that makes the resulting fatigue worth it. Unfortunately, your body will be very good at adapting to exercises and rendering previ ously very effective exercises a bit stale over time. Stale exercises will produce less stim ulus, cause more fatigue, and will actually feel like they just arent doing as much good as they were before. HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 4 1. How do you choose exercises While beginners can go months without experiencing any exercise staleness, eventually everyone will start experiencing the negative effects of having kept an exercise in the program just a bit too long. So, how do you know if an exercise is stale enough to remove and replace with another one for that target muscle group? Weve got you covered. HOW TO KNOW WHEN TO KEEP AND REMOVE EXERCISES Keep doing an exercise that 1. Gives you great tension, burn, pumps, and disruption weird feelings, tightness, soreness in the target muscle. 2. Is easy on your joints and is worth the systemic fatigue. 3. Is steadily climbing in rep strength over the months. Replace an exercise that 1. No longer gives you very good tension, burn, pumps, or disruption. 2. Is getting tough on your joints or zaps your strength for the rest of your program. 3. Has plateaued in rep strength over the last few weeks of training. HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 5 1. How do you choose exercises The fact that not all exercises will hit these conditions for change at the same time means youll rotate some exercises once a month while keeping others in for years on end. Think of your training as a comeandgo social event where some of the more prominent figures may stay for most of the event while others enter the room and exit the room as they see fit across the evening. In a very similar way, your training program over months and years should mimic this natural flow based on the feedback your body gives you. Once youve developed a fundamental understanding of which exercises you should be utilizing for hypertrophy, the question then becomes How can you be sure that youre executing your chosen exercises properly? Well answer that question in the next section. HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 6 2. WHAT IS PROPER LIFTING TECHNIQUE? In theory, proper lifting technique for optimal growth muscle has a few core features. The technique needs to stimulate muscle growth best and cause the least fatigue possi ble, which we already discussed in the last section. In addition, the chosen exercise must be executed in such a way that keeps nontarget muscles from being limiting factors. For example, if youre squatting to try to make your legs bigger but your lower back is taking most of the beating, you might have to alter your technique. Lastly, good technique needs to be replicable from rep to rep, set to set, and session to session so that you can track progress, plan weightrep increases, be mindful of fatigue, and stay safe from injury. In order to check these boxes, most exercises you do will abide by a core group of about six technique fundamentals. In a sense, no matter which exercises you do, you should nearly always seek to 1. Use a full and standardized range of motion ROM. a. For example, going all the way down to your calves when you squat or bringing the bar all the way down to your chest when you bench press. 2. Use controlled eccentrics. b. Never let the weight simply fall down. You should seek to slow the descent of every rep by actively contracting the target muscles. HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 7 2. What is proper lifting technique 3. Avoid cheating. c. Any heaving or swinging to try to get more reps that uses muscles other than the target muscle to produce force is suboptimal for obtaining a musclegrowth stimulus. 4. Ensure that the limiting factor is the target muscle itself. d. When youre almost incapable of doing another rep in the lateral raise, it should be because your shoulders are giving out, not your grip, for example. 5. Take care of your joints. e. The best technique is when your joints should feel best given the four points above. For example, if two techniques let you hit the muscles equally hard, but one technique is easier on the joints involved, that choice is probably the better one. 6. Avoid going too light or too heavy. f. Sometimes your best technique plans break down if the weight is on the heavier end or on the lighter end, so avoid repetition ranges in any exercise in which the excessively low or high reps seem to cause technique breakdowns. And thats about as complicated as good technique has to be. At the end of the day, if youre getting a great stimulus and very little fatigue, youre prob ably in a good place in terms of mixing your exercise selection with proper technique. Now that you know how to choose exercises and how to perform them correctly, youre almost ready to lift hard and heavy. But first, in order to keep the injury risk as low as possible and perform as well as possi ble, youll have to warm up. HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 8 3. HOW SHOULD YOU WARM UP? First of all, why cant you just jump right into hard training? Why do you need to warm up at all? Warming up has a few very major benefits that make it nearmandatory for serious mus clegrowth training. One of those benefits is that warming up makes the heavy lifting done after it less likely to cause injury. It makes your technique more efficient and targeted better to the muscle you want to grow. It also fires up your nervous system and allows you to push the target muscle to its limit, which usually occurs when the sets get very tough. So, how do you go about warming up properly? We have five simple steps to offer you. 5 STEPS FOR WARMING UP PROPERLY STEP 1 You can choose to do easy cardio for 510 minutes before warming up specifi cally for your first weight training exercise, but this is optional. STEP 2 Begin with a 20RM weight for the first exercise of your session and do it for around 10 reps. Yes, you read that correctly! Choose a weight you can do easily for 20 reps or more, and just do 10 highquality reps with great technique as you prepare for your working sets. HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 9 3. How should you warm up STEP 3 Do at least set with a weight halfway between your 20RM and your planned working weight for a set of about 48 reps. But, if the eventual weight youre going to lift for working sets is very heavy, you might have to do more warm up sets. For example, if your planned working weight is as follows, then youll need to do the following number of intermediate sets sets of 48 reps with a few minutes in between each 050 pounds 1 intermediate set 50200 pounds 2 intermediate sets 200400 pounds 3 intermediate sets And you would continue this trend for even greater loads. STEP 4 Do your working weight or 10 higher than your working weight for 23 reps. This highload warmup set is termed a potentiation set, and it fires up your nervous system so that your body can really push itself hard on the first working set after. STEP 5 Once youre done with that potentiation set, get your working weight ready and do as many sets as you need to. When you switch to your next exercise that day, and for each new exercise after, just do the following 5 reps with a weight halfway between your 20RM and the planned work ing weight The working weight itself for 23 reps At this point, you should be ready! If its an exercise for a muscle group you havent trained yet that day, going through the entire warmup up process for that exercise starting at step two is likely a good idea. Now, lets take a quick look at some warmup examples in which youll rest for a minute or two between each warm up set HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 10 3. How should you warm up Example 1 Upright Rows with a working weight of 65 pounds Use the 30pound straight, short bar for 10 reps. Do 45 pounds for 5 reps. Do 65 pounds for 3 reps. Then, begin working sets at 65 pounds. HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 11 3. How should you warm up Example 2 Leg Presses with a working weight of 455 pounds Put 1 45pound plate on each side of the sled and do 10 reps. Do 2 plates for 8 reps. Do 3 plates for 6 reps. Do 4 plates for 4 reps. Do 5 plates 495 pounds for 3 reps. Then, begin working sets at 4 plates and a 25 per side 455 pounds. Hopefully, these examples provide you all of the insight you need to execute your warmup sets properly. After youre warmed up, the next logical training variable of consideration is how heavy you should be lifting for your working sets. Remember, your working sets are the sets that provide most of the musclegrowth stim ulus during your sessions, which means its very important to make sure youve chosen an appropriate load. How do you do that? Well discuss that thoroughly in section four. HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 12 4. HOW HEAVY SHOULD YOU LIFT? Its mostly common knowledge that lifting heavy weights gets you bigger muscles. And, as it turns out thats true, but it begs the following question How heavy? Luckily, science has some very good answers! It turns out that, based on decades of scientific investigation, lifting a weight thats much less than about 30 of your 1RM is not going to reliably stimulate as much muscle growth as heavier weights would. You can still grow muscle lifting light like this, but youd have to do so many reps and so many sets to get even close to the most muscle growth you can stimulate with heavier weights that the sheer boredom, pain, and fatigue would limit you before you were able to grow as much as you could. At this point, you might be thinking, Okay, got it! Heavier is better. Lets just do one rep maxes to get huge! But thats not the case either. Whats the problem with going that heavy? Much of the same scientific research has found that consistently lifting much over 85 of your 1RM range can grow plenty of muscle, but it comes with some limitations and side effects. Doing so few reps per set means you have to do more sets than you would have if you had simply gone a bit lighter. Going this heavy also causes a lot of wear and tear on your joints and connective tissues, which sums up a lot of fatigue and can stall progress just weeks into your plan. HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 13 4. How heavy should you lift Lastly, going this heavy needlessly elevates the risks of acute injury without actually growing any more muscle than lighter, safer training would. In summary, we can do better than lifting ultra heavy for maximum muscle growth. Knowing these facts, we can develop some general loading recommendations for muscle growth. 5 LOADING RECOMMENDATIONS FOR MUSCLE GROWTH 1. Anything in the 3085 range of your 1RM will cause great muscle gains. 2. This means most of your training should consist of hard sets of 530 reps within a few reps of failure. 3. Some exercises will be best suited toward lower rep ranges 515, such as antigravity compounds like rows, squats, deadlifts. This is because these exercises start to be limited in performance by your ability to remain stable, not because the target muscle itself is getting tired. 4. Some exercises will be best suited toward higher rep ranges 1530, such as dumbbell, machine, and isolation movements because lighter loads in these movements can obviate stability problems, be safer, and be lifted for enough time per set to generate the highest stimuli of muscle growth. 5. Using a variety of ranges is probably best. A good start is to do about 50 of your working sets in the 1020 rep range, with another 25 in the 510 rep range and the last 25 in the 2030 rep range. HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 14 4. How heavy should you lift The big insight with loading is that, as long as your working sets fall generally between 5 and 30 reps each, the differences in growth from which end they are on and in what conditions is much smaller than if you fall outside of that range. In other words, if you are experiencing great tension and burn, great pumps, plenty of target muscle fatigue and soreness while your joints feel great and you dont feel crushed, whatever rep ranges youre using are probably pretty close to optimal. This ratio between stimulus proxies and fatigue proxies is called the stimulus to fatigue ratio SFR , and youll see it referenced in this guide several more times in various contexts. HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 15 5. HOW LONG SHOULD YOU REST BETWEEN SETS? Now you know how heavy to go for each working set, but how many reps you can get in each set is hugely based on how long you rest between each set and the next one. So, is there a correct amount of time to rest in between sets? Yes! Here are our recommendations. After a given working set, you should rest long enough until you can at least check the following boxes for yourself 1. Your target muscle can do at least 5 reps on the next set. 2. Your cardio will not limit you on the next set. 3. Your nervous systempsychology will not limit you on the next set. 4. No synergists will limit you on the next set. HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 16 5. How long should you rest between sets Heres an example with calf raises on a machine designed to illustrate how quickly the resttime boxes can be checked in some scenarios Example 1 Machine Calf Raise 1. Your target muscle can do at least 5 reps on the next set. This requires 10 seconds of rest to accomplish. 2. Your cardio will not limit you on the next set. Not applicable! Machine calf raises dont really tax your cardio vascular system. HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 17 5. How long should you rest between sets 3. Your nervous systempsychology will not limit you on the next set. This requires five seconds to accomplish because youre feeling strong and ready to go just shortly after the set is over. 4. No synergists will limit you on the next set. Not applicable! Since there really arent any synergists in machine calf raises, its all calves, and when theyre rested for literally just 10 seconds , you can go again if youd like. Example 2 Barbell Squats with 500 pounds for sets of 10 reps 1. Your target muscle can do at least 5 reps on the next set. It might take 60 seconds until your quads are recovered enough for at least another five reps to be possible. 2. Your cardio will not limit you on the next set. It might take three minutes until youre not gasping for air any more, and, if you did another set right at the threeminute mark, your quads would limit more reps from being done, not your lungs. 3. Your nervous systempsychology will not limit you on the next set. It might take four minutes until your feelings of depletion and defeat are replaced with feelings of strength and a desire for another challenge. 4. No synergists will limit you on the next set. This could take five minutes because thats how long it will take your lower back to stop hurting from all of the metabolic byproducts of your last squat set. Thus, because this is the limiting factor, youll have to rest at least five minutes after your set of squats for the next set to be maximally productive. HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 18 5. How long should you rest between sets Does this mean you must go as soon as youve checked all four boxes? No, absolutely not. But it means you can go again if youd like. If, however, youd like to rest a bit more, thats fine too! The big downside here comes from not resting enough rather than from resting a bit too much. That being said, if you dont want to spend too much extra time in the gym so that you can spend more time enjoying hobbies, work, or rest and recovery outside of the gym, its probably wise not to stray too far away from the smallest tenable rest times. HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 19 6. HOW MANY SETS SHOULD YOU DO? The general answer to this question is enough sets to trigger robust muscle growth, but since thats much more of a tautology than a good answer, weve got a few sci encebacked recommendations as well. Enough stimulus to ensure youre likely growing the most muscle tends to occur when the sets you did for a specific muscle give it a good or even great pump, tire it out plenty, and lead to a day or two of postworkout tightness, weakness, and maybe even slightly painful soreness to the touch. The number of sets it usually takes to accomplish this task is as follows Beginner Can often be 15 sets per session people training from 0 to 3 years Intermediate Can often be 210 sets per session people training from 3 to 7 years Advanced Can often be 312 sets per session people training from 7 to 10 years HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 20 6. How many sets should you do Those are big ranges, so if youre getting good pumps and other good proxies for stimu lus, you can just stay with the number of sets youre currently doing. If youre not getting much of a stimulus, inch up the number of sets week by week by only one set per muscle group per session at a time until youre getting great stimuli. If you inch up too much, you might experience the downsides of doing too many sets, which present themselves asfollows When you cannot recover strength to at least baseline for your next session If you did 100 pounds in an exercise for sets of 10 last week, but this week youre so tired from all the sets that you can only do sets of eight with that weight, youre probably doing too many sets and need to reduce them ASAP. When you have overlapping soreness into your next session If you trained quads on Monday and they are still sore to the touch on Thursday when its time to train them again, its probably wise to reduce next Mondays number of quad sets so that next Thursday you can be fresh for the workout. One of the best and simplest approaches to doing the proper number of sets per muscle per session looks something like this First, start at the lowest number of sets per session that gets you a decent pump and muscle disruption. This might leave you saying something like, Okay, I feel that! Second, add one set per week if and as you get used to the work. For example, your pumps and disruption dont improve or decline a bit and your rep strength is still above baseline. Third, if you get to doing too much, its time to give the body a break and do fewer sets for a while. Now youre all squared away for determining how many sets to do per muscle group, but how many sets should you be doing in total for all muscle groups trained in a given session at the gym? HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 21 6. How many sets should you do A couple of hints at whats too many sets come to mind. If you accumulate enough systemic fatigue during the workout, which means being tired in the core of your being versus being tired in a specific muscle, you wont be able to muster the effort to push your target muscle close to failure. This means doing any more sets would simply be too many sets for that workout. In other words, if youre stopping a set because youre just tired versus your target muscle being close to its local failure point, doing more sets is probably a bad idea. The point at which most people reach this systemic fatigue speedbump lies somewhere between 15 and 30 working sets for the sessionworkout without counting warm up sets. If youre very strong and training huge swaths of muscle like legs and back, 15 total work ing sets might be around the point when trying to do any more sets is a poor strategy. If youre smaller and, specifically, if youre training mostly smaller muscles in that work out, such as biceps, side delts, calves, andor forearms, you might be able to crank up to 30 sets per session and still be doing productive work in the latter sets. Its definitely possible to still be getting good benefits from more than 30 sets per session, but its not likely. If you have to do that many or more sets per session regularly, the best approach is probably to increase the number of weekly workout sessions youre planning so that you can do fewer sets in each and make sure all the sets are of a high quality. Speaking of quality, one of the big determining factors of set quality is whether or not the muscle itself came fairly close to failure before you stopped the set. But how close is close enough? And, is it possible to have too much of a good thing when it comes to muscular failure? Lets find out next. HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 22 7. SHOULD YOU TRAIN TO FAILURE? Research on training to failure has found that sets whose tailend reps get close to failure grow more muscle than sets whose reps didnt get very close to failure. But that same research holds many other sometimes surprising insights as well. Lets dig into them. After numerous studies, it seems pretty clear that on average over the course of a 23 month training program, taking every programmed working set to failure shows no clear benefit over having all of the working sets stop at about three reps in reserve from failure, or basically when the bardumbbellcablemachine begins to really slow down with each successive rep in most cases. In addition, it has been found that training all the way to failure, while causing no clear growth upside, likely causes a vastly disproportionate amount of fatigue. This high level of fatigue accumulates over weeks of training and can prevent the trainee from stringing together as many productive workout sessions as possible. On the other hand, training with a relative effort of much more than three reps in reserve seems to challenge the muscles so little as to cause notably less growth than training a bit closer to failure. Note too that our language of more than three reps in reserve refers to getting further and further away from failure. For example, this might mean bench pressing six reps at 225 pounds when doing 10 reps would have landed you at technical failure, which would represent having trained to four reps in reserve. What were saying is that the sweet spot in this case would be bench pressing 225 pounds for seven, eight, or even nine reps. HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 23 7. Should you train to failure Taking all of this information into account, a very viable approach to relative effort over the mesocycle of training starts to look something like this Start at your best guess of 3 RIR, and then write down your weight and reps for that workout. Add weight andor reps each week and try to match weight andor reps from last week in every working set even though these additions may make each work set a bit harder each successive week. For example, doing 100 pounds for 10 reps in week 1, then doing 105 pounds for 10 reps in week 2. Or, similarly, you could do 100 pounds for 10 reps in week 1, and then do 100 pounds for 11 reps in week 2. Sooner or later, youll hit failure on most of your sets and fail to match or beat your prior weeks performance. And this is very normal! This will occur because you cant just keep getting linearly stronger forever. But it will also occur much faster than strength itself peaks because fatigue accumulates over the weeks and eventually adds to the difficulty of continued progression. When this point of plateau and regression occurs, in most cases, the best practice will be to take some sort of break from hard training so that fatigue can dissipate. After that break, you can then begin the process of accumulation once again. HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 24 7. Should you train to failure HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 25 7. Should you train to failure This is the general process, but we can give some slightly more specific advice to you based on your current level of physique training advancement Beginner Starting at 45 reps in reserve RIR and ending at 2 RIR is great for technique establishment. More isnt needed for the best results! Grinding to failure often can teach and reinforce bad technique. Intermediate Starting at 3 RIR and ending at 01 RIR is best. Embrace 0 RIR for exercises that wont fall on you if you fail, but limit yourself to 1 RIR for those that will! Intermediates will experience the challenge of pushing as hard as possible while demonstrating excellent technique. Advanced Starting at 2 RIR and ending beyond failure for one week might be an effective idea. 2 RIR in week 1 1 RIR in week 2 01 RIR in week 3 Assisted forced reps or drop sets in week 4 This is done to get as much shortterm stimulus as possible and potentially push very growthresistant muscles beyond their growth thresholds by even a small margin. HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 26 8. HOW OFTEN SHOULD YOU TRAIN? Okay, were really getting somewhere now! You know how to choose exercises, how to execute them with good technique, how hard and heavy the working sets should be, and how many sets to do per muscle group and per session. Now the question becomes How many times per week should we train for best muscle growth results? The simple answer is that it depends on if youre recovered enough to train again. HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 27 8. How often should you train The core idea here is that the best training occurs when youre very recovered, and that the body has multiple mechanisms that make creating new growth stimuli much more difficult when youre not properly recovered as opposed to when you are. Essentially, you should train a given muscle again when the muscle has recovered enough to no longer feel sore and to perform at its normal strength levels or beyond. Muscles that are still sore or still too fatigued to perform at their usual abilities probably need more rest than they need more training. That being said, probably one of the biggest factors in determining how long it takes a given muscle to recover is the number of hard sets it performed during the session prior. For example, if you train your biceps with four working sets in a session, you might be able to recover every day or every other day depending on a few other factors like exercise selection, and you thus might be able to train the biceps four days per week or so. On the other hand, if you decided to have each biceps workout contain eight working sets per session, then you may only be recovered enough to perform two such sessions a week. HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 28 8. How often should you train Thats the general idea, but there are both topend and bottomend limits on session volume and effective training frequency. Its usually not maximally productive or timeef ficient to train a given muscle with less than two working sets per session, and its potentially too damaging and excessive to train most muscles with much more than 12 working sets per session. The result is that you might be able to train a muscle as often as six times per week if you do very little volume per session or as infrequently as two times per week if you train the muscle with more sets per session. Training all seven days of the week or just once per week are suboptimal in most cases. HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 29 8. How often should you train Lastly, higher frequencies can actually support higher total weekly volumes per muscle and thus more growth, but they are so taxing to all fatigue axes including joint and connective tissue wear and tear that, in most cases, very highfrequency programs can only be most effectively performed for a few months before a much lowerfrequency cooling off period is required. So yes, your friend might have grown her legs visibly from that crazy five times per week leg training program she did, but thats no way to train for the longterm. However, every now and again it can be a good idea when legs are the shortterm priority. Now that training frequency per muscle group is sorted, how many total sessions per week should you be doing? The most important deciding factor for how many days to choose to go to the gym per week is adherence. If you give anyone a program which asks them to commit to more gym time than they can adhere to, its just not worth it. In these cases, they may fail to the point that nothing productive will happen because their chronic inability to make all the sessions happen may discourage them from training at all. So, if someone could ideally benefit from six sessions per week but their schedule makes four sessions a strain, giving them a program that features three sessions per week and seeing how they handle it is almost certainly the best solution. For folks of different training levels, there is a bit more nuance Beginner 24 sessions per week You dont want to burn them out You want to ignite their desire for more training by having them do a bit less, not create a desire for less training by having them do too much. They make great gains at low frequencies anyway because they are beginners and very sensitive to muscle growth stimuli. Most programs will be all muscles in every session, as there arent enough sessions to focus on any muscle group in particular. HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 30 8. How often should you train Intermediate 36 sessions per week They wont burn out because they love training, so up to six times per week is fine for those who really want it and have already proven to be successful at a frequency of five times per week. They need more sessions to do each muscle justice as the volumes they need to do per muscle are climbing from their beginner days. Split programs become common pushpull, upperlower, etc.. Advanced 512 sessions per week For advanced lifters, each muscle needs to be first in its session at least once a week so that it can get the best, freshest, training stimulus. Training only two or three muscles per session is very common because advanced lifters get so fatigued just by training two or three muscles in a row that they cant do much more in a session without it being considered junk volume. If they train only five or six sessions per week, they likely need to emphasize some of their muscles for a few months and emphasize others for a few months by putting emphasized muscles first in each session and by putting deemphasized muscles last and capping them at just enough volume to maintain their size MV, which is only about a third of the volume they will typically need to grow the most from. This concept is known as their maximum adaptive volume MAV. If they tried to train all of their muscles at around MAV, they would be running into junk volume problems daily at the end of each session. Twicedaily sessions can take you to eight, 10, or even 12 sessions total if desired as an advanced lifter. Thus you can focus on all muscles again, but your recovery and lifestyle need to be calculated very strategically to survive this much weekly hard training. HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 31 9. HOW SHOULD YOU PROGRESS? Once you understand training frequency, its important to figure out how to progress from week to week to produce consistent muscle gains. On the one hand, a progression that is too aggressive will lead to fatigue overaccumu lation, performance loss, and the need to back off and let that fatigue dissipate. On the other hand, a progression that is too meek will result in lots of time wasted on sessions that are too easy to cause the best longterm growth outcomes. In order to avoid both downsides, heres a progression formula you can try with your own training Choose 1. A weight in the 530 rep range for any given exercise. 2. Enough sets to get you pumped and notably disrupted, which is usually somewhere between 35 sets in the first session of the mesocycle. Then 1. Do that weight at 3 RIR. 2. Do enough sets to get you pumped and notably disrupted, but stop when you do. 3. Write down your weight and reps for each set. HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 32 9. How should you progress For next weeks session of that same weekday 1. Add enough reps, weight, or both to keep your RIR the same or lower it by one. For example 100 pounds for 10 reps at 3 RIR in week 1 ??? pounds for 10 reps at 23 RIR in week 2 answer can be 110 pounds 100 pounds for ??? reps at 23 RIR in week 2 answer can be 12 reps ??? pounds for ??? reps at 23 RIR in week 2 answer can be 105 pounds and 11 reps However, there is one hard rule for progression. Your next week must beat your performance from last week. This can be done just by a tiny bit at the same RIR or by only as much as 1 RIR lower. In other words, dont hop from 3 RIR to 0 RIR in one week, as the fatigue accumulation will just mess up future weeks. Just seeking to add either 510 pounds to the load or one rep to the reps each time can do wonders for simplifying all of the above. 2. Add sets from last week Add one set per session if you got little pump or disruption last time. Dont add sets if you got a good pump and disruption last time. Consider subtracting a set if you didnt remotely heal from soreness on time for the same muscle later in week. HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 33 10. WHEN AND HOW SHOULD YOU DELOAD? If you decide to follow our recommendations on load, rep, and set progressions across the mesocycle, youre going to be adding some combination of weight and reps each week. And in some weeks, youll even be adding full sets to your workouts. At some point, youll be performing way above your previous abilities, and the increased levels of accumulating fatigue will start to prevent you from improving or even matching your performances from weeks past. HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 34 10. When and how should you deload As obvious as this may sound, training while getting weaker and weaker is the opposite of progress. And, it turns out that high levels of fatigue can actually reduce or even prevent muscle growth at the biochemical level. Because of this, its incredibly important to bring fatigue back down to baseline before beginning another accumulation phase once your fatigue has gotten high enough to consistently prevent you from getting stronger for reps week after week. If just one or a few of your muscle groups have maxed out their current performance but the rest of your muscle groups and system feel good, a recovery session is in order. Heres how to execute a recovery session 1. Since we all experience underperformance from time to time, dont do a recovery session unless youve had two sessions in a row for that same muscle that result in underperformance. On your second session of underperformance, finish that session as strong as you can. 2. During the next session for that muscle, do half the planned sets for half the planned reps and with half of the planned weight. If youre thinking, Wow, that sounds like it would be really easy, you are correct! But this is the point. Recovery sessions are designed to reduce fatigue, something only easy training can do. 3. Resume the sessions the week after at two thirds of the planned sets, but keep going up as you were in weight andor reps. 4. Add weight, reps, and sets from there as you normally would. Using such recovery sessions can renew fatigued muscle groups for another week of hard training if needed, and using a few recovery sessions stacked together for half of a week can renew your progress for another few weeks if needed. However, after about 48 weeks of consistent, hard training, multiple muscle groups will have likely demanded recovery sessions by that point. Your entire body and even your HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 35 10. When and how should you deload mind will feel exhausted, overused, weak, and unresponsive, even down to diminishing the quality of your pumps. Additionally, your persession working set volumes may start to get incredibly high as you chase everdiminishing returns, and almost every set will be taken to failure or very close, which will inevitably increase the fatigue youre experiencing by an exponential factor. This high local and systemic fatigue will cause you to underperform in pretty much all of your muscle groups and exercises in the same week. At this point, youre carrying so much fatigue that a simple series of recovery days wont cut it anymore. When this happens, youll need to deload, which is essentially an entire week of recovery instead of just a few days. Its execution can look something like this 1. First half of the week at half the planned sets for half the planned reps at 80100 of last weeks weight. These sessions should be heavy, but very low volume and nowhere remotely close to failure. 2. Last half of the week at half the planned sets for half the planned reps and half of the planned weight! This should be ultra easy, and you can even combine a few days in that latter half of the week into one workout since doing the workouts individually might have you driving 30 minutes to and from the gym to do 10 minutes of exercise each time. If you can condense your sessions, feel free to do so. After such a deload week, you should be so recovered that you can productively train for another mesocycle before needing a break again. Now that youre planning and organizing your training on monthslong periods, lets take a look at some of the higherlevel forms of training organization that can help you plan and experience progress for months and years on end in a very effective and scientifically congruent way. HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 36 11. HOW SHOULD YOU PLAN TRAINING PHASES? Each training week with an organized purpose is termed a microcycle in modern sport science. An accumulation phase of 48 increasingly harder microcycles with a oneweek deload at the end with the purpose of clearing fatigue is in total termed a mesocycle . And, about three mesocycles all sequenced in a row in pursuit of the same general goal is known as a block of training. HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 37 11. How should you plan training phases In the beginning of each block of training for muscle growth, your volume sensitivity is very high and your joint and connective tissue fatigue is very low because youre very fresh. Thus, you can both handle heavy loads and dont need a lot of sets of them to grow the most muscle. In addition, each workout highly disrupts your sensitive muscles, and it can take your muscles quite a while to heal from any single workout for that very reason. Because of these aligning factors, it may be wise to consider programming a few more of your working sets than usual in the 510 rep range and fewer in the 1020 and 2030 ranges. Lastly, your permuscle group frequency of training can be on the lower end or around two or three times per week for nearly all trained muscles. As the block progresses into the second and third mesocycles, you can consider adding a session to some of the muscle groups that seem to be healing quite fast such as the calves, biceps, and side delts for many people. Instead of training them two or three times per week, you can, over the next two mesocycles, increase them to three or four times per week on average. This session addition is totally optional, but doing so might eek out a bit more growth than sticking with the same session numbers the entire time. Once youve added sessions, our recommendation is to add most or all of the new sets in the 1020 or 2030 rep ranges since these rep ranges dont cause as much joint and connective tissue fatigue as heavier sets. When you add the extra days of training, youll of course also be adding exercises. We recommend adding exercises that comport well with the higher rep ranges youre using them in and ones that are easier than average on the joints. For example, while barbell squats might be best in the 510 range and hack squats might beat up your knees a bit too much to add later in a block, you could add sets of 2030 reps in the leg press while going easy on the load and joint stress but crazy hard on the highrep burning effort! That being said, remember that you dont have to make any of these changes. But, if youre looking for ways to modify your successive mesocycles in a block, going lighter and higher frequency is probably a better move than the alternatives. If youre really looking to consider advanced progression factors, you might decide to choose exercises with a lower SFR that stress the stretch and eccentric of the movement less than others in the first mesocycle of a block. Conversely, consider choosing exercises that are the highest possible SFR and stress the eccentric and stretch of the movement intensely later on when your physiology is more resistant to growth and needs to be exposed to as much stimulus as possible to grow further. HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 38 11. How should you plan training phases After an entire block of increasing loads, volumes, and training frequencies, its very likely that you are going to be physically and mentally exhausted. Research is very clear that when youre very fatigued, you cannot make your best gains in training. And, in some cases, you may not even be able to make any gains at all, which obviously presents an enormous problem when becoming as muscular as possible is the name of the game. When you reach this point, its time to bring fatigue down so much that you have enough margin to train for another block or two after with only deloads to bring it down. To bring this much fatigue down, you can choose one of two plans of action. LOWVOLUME MAINTENANCE PHASES The first option is a lowvolume maintenance phase of training. These phases typically last for 34 weeks, and feature maintenance volumes or about a third of the number of sets typically featured in your normal block training that remain stagnant through the entire mesocycle. In terms of set and rep recommendations, its probably best to perform most of your sets in the 510 rep range to allow volume sensitivity to climb back up as high as it can. Regarding frequency, training each muscle once or twice per week should allow fatigue to decline greatly while muscle mass is just barely preserved. After deloading at the end of this very unchallenging mesocycle, youll be ultra low on fatigue and incredibly sensitive to volume, upon which youd begin the first lowvolume mesocycle of your next threemesocycle training block. ACTIVE REST PHASES An alternative to the maintenance phase is the active rest phase. This is a phase of just 23 weeks in which limited or no lifting at all occurs. Simply put, the goal is to have fun, sleep a lot, eat well, and enjoy your life. This is also the perfect time to go on vacation, take a trip, or do something else you find physically and psychologically rejuvenating. HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 39 11. How should you plan training phases If you do go into the gym, try to keep it to no more than two total sessions per week. And just to be clear, were talking about two total sessions across all muscle groups. Within these two total weekly sessions, use less than 50 of your normal weights for half the persession sets and reps you would usually perform. These ultraeasy weeks can reduce fatigue to almost zero, which can prime you for another productive block or two of training ahead. How do you choose between these strategies? If you need a diet break at maintenance along with a training break and you want that diet break to be a bit longer than 23 weeks, a maintenance phase or even several in a row is your best bet. If your diet dynamics dont require a maintenance phase and you want to get back to growth training as soon as possible, definitely give the active rest phase some thought. HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 40 12. BEGINNER VS. INTERMEDIATE VS. ADVANCED TRAINING Different training foci can change based on your level of advancement in lifting, so its important to understand where you fall on the spectrum. To simplify things, weve outlined the following parameters to help you identify yourself into one of the three training age categories Beginner You just lift and you keep getting bigger and stronger automatically without much complexity. You get stronger even when losing weight. Youre most likely to have lifted for 03 years, although this time frame could be longer in some cases. Intermediate Youve hit your first plateau and had to figure your way around it. You find that you need to nail the basics consistently to keep progressing. You get a little stronger during weight loss periods but only by a small margin. Youre most likely to have lifted for 37 years, although this time frame could be less or more. HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 41 12. Beginner vs. intermediate vs. advanced training Advanced If your sleep, recovery, nutrition, and training isnt meticulous and wellplanned, you simply dont make gains. Best case scenario, you maintain rep strength during weight loss phases, but often you lose a bit of rep strength. Youre most likely to have lifted for more than seven years, although this time frame could be less or more. If youre not sure which one you are, choose the less experienced of your two best choices and go from there. So if you think you might be an intermediate but you also might still be a beginner, do yourself the favor of assuming youre a beginner and func tionally operate out of that assumption. Once youve made your choice, or if you train other individuals who are of a certain advancement in their training age, you can incorporate some of the following training recommendations for each level. Beginners should 1. Do mostly sets of 510 reps for getting stronger while improving technique. 2. Focus mostly on the compound basics as those will target the most muscle and build the most strength and movement compe tency for later. 3. Focus tons on improving and solidifying their technique because proper technique will pay increased growth and decreased injury risk dividends for the rest of their training career. 4. Avoid 1 RIR or harder training as thats when fatigue tends to negatively impact the technique of beginner trainees. 5. Avoid nearMRV volumes to the point of performance declines for the same reason as mentioned in point four. HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 42 12. Beginner vs. intermediate vs. advanced training 6. Train each muscle in each of their 24 total weekly sessions because most beginners will neither need any more than that for best gains nor psychologically be able to handle much higher frequencies. Intermediates should 1. Do mostly sets of 510 and 1020 reps as they can now do higher reps without technique breakdown. At this point, they will also likely need the variation of extra rep ranges to keep their gains coming along at the best pace possible. 2. Focus mostly on the free weight compound basics and some isolations. This is primarily to get great results while still building a strong core, which will support more muscle building later. At the same time, intermediates should start to use some different machines and exercises to see which exercises have better SFRs for their unique anatomy. 3. Focus on altering their basic technique to fit their personal SFRs. They should now be much more skilled in detecting tension in their muscles as well as positions that cause the most and least joint stress. Utilizing this knowledge should make their technique better in most exercises. 4. Push from 3 RIR to 1 or even 0 RIR for most mesocycles while focusing on breaking barriers toward the end of each mesocycle. The intermediate stage is when most people learn what hard training really means. 5. Train from MEV to MRV in most mesocycles as this will now be the best way to ensure maximum gains. 6. Train each muscle 24 times per week across 36 total sessions because they both need the extra sessions to make the best gains and can psychologically handle the extra work. HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 43 12. Beginner vs. intermediate vs. advanced training Advanced lifters should 1. Do mostly sets of 1020 reps, with some in the 510 rep range and some in the 2030 rep range. In most cases, advanced lifters will be a bit too strong relative to their joint and connective tissue abilities to be able to survive intact with too much training coming from the heavy 510 rep range. 2. Focus mostly on the best SFR exercises for them instead of exploring the gym for new exercises to try out. Advanced lifters should still explore to some degree, but most of them have very good ideas regarding which exercises will work well and which exercises may not. 3. Explore techniques that maximize the SFR especially by techni cally altering commonly performed lifts. For example, advanced lifters might put their feet closer together during squats and use a squat wedge in addition to wedged weightlifting shoes so that they can even better target their quads. 4. Push from 2 RIR to failure or even beyond while preserving their mindmuscle connection . This implies ultrahard training that still targets the right muscles at high SFRs. 5. Train from MEV to MRV in most mesocycles. However, advanced lifters might have such high MEVs and low MRVs that this may not be a very big window for them anymore. In some cases, this could require a modest addition of 12 sets per session per muscle over the entire mesocycle. 6. Train each muscle 26 times per week across 512 sessions with twoadays used in a phasic manner over the block if they are interested in competition or the highest levels of personal phy sique transformation. HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 44 12. Beginner vs. intermediate vs. advanced training HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 45 13. HOW DO YOU PRIORITIZE MUSCLE GROUPS? When people say that theyre prioritizing a muscle, what does that even mean? In very basic terms, it means they really care about that specific muscle group growing as much as possible to the extent that theyre willing to arrange their training in a special way to ensure growth. HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 46 13. How do you prioritize muscle groups 4 MOTIVATIONS FOR PRIORITIZING MUSCLE GROUPS More specifically, you can have some combination of the following motivations for prioritizing a muscle over others HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 47 13. How do you prioritize muscle groups 1. One side or muscle is bigger than the other. Maybe one bicep is bigger than the other. Maybe your legs are disproportionately bigger than your upper body. Maybe your chest is much bigger than your back. Maybe your back is impressively thick but not very wide. 2. Limited resources require prioritization. Going hard on all muscle groups leaves very little room to push any one of them much harder than youre already pushing it. For example, if you wanted to prioritize your legs but youre still training your upper body as hard as possible, you might only have the energy to do a little bit more leg training than usual, which may not be enough to ignite any meaningful change. But, if you reduce the amount of work youre doing on your upper body, that frees up time, energy, and recovery resources to let your legs grow bigger if you want to prioritize them. 3. You just plain old want something to stand out. Having big arms is never wrong, and if you want bigger arms, you can prior itize them so they get bigger than everything else at a faster rate. 4. Time constraints If you can only train three times per week, for example, but youre an inter mediate and want to grow your whole body, training all of the muscles as much as they need might lead to 40set or even 50set workouts, the latter half of which will inevitably be junk volumeheavy and littered with abysmal SFRs. Instead, it would be better to put half of your body on maintenance vol umes, then train the other half from MEV to MRV for a few mesocycles in a row a training block, switch, and then repeat for longterm total body growth that occurs in spurts rather than on a continuous basis. These are the best reasons to consider prioritization. Now, lets take a look at the six steps of how to do it. HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 48 13. How do you prioritize muscle groups 6 STEPS FOR PRIORITIZING MUSCLE GROUPS STEP 1 Train the prioritized muscle from its local MEV to its local MRV. Systemic fatigue should not be the limiting factor here. In other words, make sure that your inability for that muscle to keep making PRs at the ends of your mesocycles is occurring because the muscle itself is being wiped out, not your cardiovascular abilities or other systemic contributors. Relative to this specific point, remember that muscle fatigue causes growth. Systemic fatigue reduces growth. STEP 2 Train the prioritized muscle first in most of its weekly sessions. If you tell someone youre really prioritizing your back, your back better be the first thing trained in most of your upper body sessions. Otherwise, youre not really prioritizing it at all. Training a muscle first or early in most sessions means you train it fresh with as much energy dedicated to causing a muscle growth stimulus as possible. This also gives you the best chance of never accumulating any amount of junk volume for your prioritized muscle group, as every set is likely to be if very high quality. STEP 3 Consider training it the hardest after a day off each week. For example, if Sunday is your rest day, that means that your session on Monday would feature your prioritized muscle group being trained first and likely hardest when compared to your other weekly training sessions. STEP 4 Choose exercises that have the highest RSMs with SFRs considered but not exclusively. Raw stimulus magnitude RSM is the total amount of musclegrowth signal you send to a muscle. In the context of fullbody training, the SFR is more important because it takes fatigue into account, which prevents the fatigue overflow of some muscles from affecting others. But, if you are prioritizing a certain muscle group, there is some logic to allowing plenty of room for it to accumulate loads of fatigue while reducing your training volume potential for other muscles, since youre not pushing them as hard anyway and dont need as much volume allotted to them at the time. To keep it simple, think HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 49 13. How do you prioritize muscle groups of it like a monetary budget. If you really value eating out at classy, highend restau rants, you might have to create more room in your budget for eating out by limiting the amount of money you spend on clothes each month. Its a give and take. In short, it might not be the worst idea to smash your target muscle group with enough high RSM movements and loads to drive maximum growth even if it comes at the temporary expense of other muscle groups growing at their fastest. STEP 5 Increase the frequency of training for your prioritized muscles toward the higher range of what is sustainable. If you normally train biceps two times per week, for example, prioritizing them may lead you to increase their frequency to three times per week. STEP 6 Reduce your training of the most interfering muscle groups to MEV or even MV. Reducing the training of the most systemically andor axiallyfatiguing muscles is usually wise when prioritizing other muscles. The most common instance of this would be reducing your leg and back training, for example, if you want to bring up other muscles. Ultimately, you should reduce as many muscles to MEV or MV as you need to in order to have lots of energy to train the prioritized muscles. Unfortunately, reducing all other muscles by a mere set or two per week probably wont offer you much if any additional training capacity in most cases. Lastly, consider synergists as well. If your goal is maximum triceps growth, take a look at your pressing movements for chest and reduce them as much as needed often down to MV volumes to make sure the triceps are nearly always either recovering from a hard triceps session or are fresh and ready to be trained hard again, instead of recovering from assisting the chest in hard chest training. If youre prioritizing more of your muscles, have larger and stronger muscles, and are more advanced, youll need to put more muscles into MEV or MV volumes to buy enough fatigue clearance room to make the conditions best for growth for your prioritized muscles. Again, thinking about the prioritization of your muscle groups in terms of a mon etary budget can be an extremely helpful framework of consideration as you do your best to structure your training plan accordingly. HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 50 14. PREVENTING AND MANAGING INJURIES You cant ever make the gym a completely safe place to be. Steel is heavy and hard, and when it falls, sometimes people get hurt. But, through your approach to training, you can do things as intelligently as possible while reducing the chance of injury. Here are four tips on how to do just that in your muscle growth training plan Tip 1 Dont be an idiot. Always warm up, and be sure to keep your technique as clean as possible. Avoid pointless gym challenges and lifting heavy at random. In other words, when your slightly crazy training partner asks you, Do you think we could curl 225 if we both grabbed the barbell at the same time? , your best bet is to politely decline for the sake of an extended training career. Dont lift any loads you cant handle for at least 5 very controlled reps. Youre a bodybuilder! Not a powerlifter. HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 51 14. Preventing and managing injuries Tip 2 Ramp up your volumes and loads slowly. Add no more than 12 sets per muscle group per session. Rapid volume increases have been correlated very tightly with injuries that tend to occur just after an abrupt escalation, so increase your sets slowly. Add no more load than reduces your RIR by one in each week. In most cases, this means going up by 510 pounds. Dont slap an extra 45 pounds on the bar because you feel like it. Being patient will notably reduce your injury risk. Dont train with overlapping soreness often. Training with microdamage may predispose you to injury. If you train with overlapping soreness on occasion, dont add any more sets to the session youre doing or to the one before its next weeks equivalent so that youre not doing more when you already cant recover from doing the normal. Tip 3 Pay attention. If a certain technique hurts your joints more and more with each rep or set, pause, rack the weight, reevaluate, and make a change if the pain continues. HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 52 14. Preventing and managing injuries Tip 4 Deload like youre supposed to. Dont skip the deload or cut it short! Deloads can be boring but your body needs them to literally heal. Skipping or cutting a deload short may be asking for trouble in the form of injury in your next mesocycle. Dont add work during your deload cause youre itching to train. Deloads are supposed to be easy and lowvolume. If your deload isnt super easy, its not much of a deload. In fact, its just another week of hard training where your fatigue doesnt really fall much in preparation for the next mesocycle, which is both rather unproductive and arguably dangerous. Failing to deload properly will cause fatigue to accumulate much faster than anticipated in that next mesocycle, which will undoubtedly lead to problems including an increased risk of injury. Hopefully, you will take all of this insight into account and never get hurt. But, because the nature of hypertrophy training is one of overload and pushing beyond limits with heavy weights, injury for almost everyone at some point in the game is nearly inevitable. If and when you do get hurt, please give the following steps a look before you make your next move. But before you read through the following steps, please remember that when youre hurt in a certain muscle or joint but still want to train other muscles that use other joints, make sure the rest of your training doesnt bother the injury to any meaningful extent. This way, youre not just continuously reaggravating the injury and not letting it heal completely. HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 53 14. Preventing and managing injuries For the injured area itself 1. See a medical professional and do all the rehabilitation, surgery, and time away they instruct. 2. When youre cleared for activity, start with sets of 2030 reps at 510 RIR and work on your range of motion. You can end this phase of training when you can perform a full range of motion for the movement or joint without pain. 3. When you can navigate the injured area painfree with a normal range of motion, work up to 30 RIR in 2030rep sets but only for a few sets a few times per week. HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 54 14. Preventing and managing injuries Justinjured tissues have very poor volume tolerance, so doing a bit fewer sets like 12 per session 23 times per week is better than doing more sets. 4. Add sets and cycle from MEV to MRV in the 2030 rep range. This is done once youre very comfortably recovering from just a few sets of 2030 reps. 5. Once youve spent time training comfortably and painfree in the higher rep ranges, slowly add load to some of those sets to get into the 1020 range. Add load slowly and let the reps fall by two or so per session in most cases. Dont just jump from your 30RM to your 10RM unless you want to get hurt again. 6. Keep slowly adding load, and eventually dip back into the 510 range. Once youve been there for a few weeks, deload, and then you should be in the clear to resume your normal training protocols. HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 55 15. MATCHING YOUR TRAINING TO YOUR DIET Making sure your eating matches your training is critical for the best muscle growth results. After all, muscle growth is fueled by food, and your muscle tissue is literally made of the chemicals you consume from food. In most cases, matching your training to your diet comes down to identifying your primary goal. Usually, there are three main options training to gain as much muscle as possible via a caloric surplus, training to maintain via isocaloric dieting, and training for fat loss and muscle retention via a caloric deficit. HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 56 15. Matching your training to your diet If youre trying to gain as much muscle as possible, your best bet is to train across the entire volume spectrum. In nearly all cases, this means starting your mesocycles at your best guess of your MEV and finishing them around your MRV. And obviously, its import ant to make sure that your diet matches the level of focus and intensity you are bringing to your training sessions, which almost certainly implies eating in a caloric surplus. If youre already eating in a caloric surplus to gain muscle, you have to make sure youre actually training hard enough to grow muscle. Unfortunately, less voluminous training with lots of surplus food will predictably cause fat gain you might not be interested in. And, as you might imagine, this is a mistake many wellintentioned lifters have made over the years. If youre eating simply to maintain, you can still definitely train from your MEV to your MRV in an attempt to gain as much muscle as possible. However, unless youre a begin ner, this approach probably wont yield as much growth as youd like since eating at maintenance fails to account for one of the biggest ingredients in the recipe for optimal gains a caloric surplus. If you really want to gain as much muscle as possible and you are justifiably lean enough to do so, your best bet is to structure your food intake in context of a caloric surplus. That being said, sometimes eating and training to maintain your current body composition is the most appropriate thing. For example, if you need a break from hard, highvolume training and you want to train at your MV for a while, eating at maintenance is ideal. This would also be true for anyone currently in an active rest phase and in a deload no matter the phase. Lastly, if youre dieting to lose fat, training from your MEV to your MRV is a wise idea to preserve as much muscle as possible. If you dont train hard enough, you will likely and very unfortunately lose muscle in hypocaloric conditions. That being said, a few more intricate tips about progressions apply when training for muscle growth in a caloric deficit. HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 57 15. Matching your training to your diet Here they are 1. Make smaller load and rep jumps between sessions as your adaptive abilities will be worsened and your fatigue accumulation will occur more quickly than usual. 2. Expect your MRV to come down to you. If your usual MRV for back training is, lets say, about 20 sets per week, you might be surprised to find that your MRV for back training during a fat loss phase is only 16 sets per week. If you autoregulate your training, this will occur automatically and this is one of the best reasons to autoregulate your training. But definitely dont go chasing your hypercaloric MRV while on a deficit as it will almost certainly be out of your reach. 3. Dont prioritize any muscle groups, and train all the ones you dont want to lose size on at MEV. If you prioritize muscle groups during a fat loss phase, your body doesnt really have the food to make a lot of gains anyway, and the reduction of your nonprioritized muscles to MV may result in significant losses for them. HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 58 16. TROUBLESHOOTING LACK OF PROGRESS There could be many reasons youre not seeing the results you want, but the biggest reason most people experience a lack of progress is that theyre expecting linear gains like they made when they were a beginner. And yet, because theyre more advanced now, they should actually be expecting gains of diminishing magnitudes. The second biggest reason you might not be getting the gains you want is just genetics. Not all of us were built to get 20inch arms, and dare I say many of us were built for accomplishments slightly more beneficial to society! If youve made peace with your training age and your genetics, there may be some other factors to attend to that can improve your results. Here are eight such factors 1. Appropriate and consistent training and diet If youre inconsistent, the inconsistency is the problem with your gains. Only when you can fit together tight strings of completed workouts over days, weeks, and months will you see your best gains. So, if a lack of consistency is something that has been holding you back from making your best strides forward, this is certainly the most obvious factor to address. 2. MEVMRV training for each muscle group targeted Do you know if youre hitting your MRV on your calves? If youve never taken their training volume high enough to stall them out, you dont actually know. But seriously, how many people actually know what their MRV is for their calves? HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 59 16. Troubleshooting lack of progress For all you know, they might benefit from much more volume than youre cur rently training them with, and no amount of extra intensity will make up for that. If youre curious about a muscle group, slowly raise the number of sets you train it with and see where growth is best. It might be higher than you think! On the contrary, you might be smashing your pecs with justaroundMRV or even higher volumes. You can instead reduce the amount of training you do for pecs that barely gets them pumped and a bit sore, and see if training at that level or just above it causes better gains. If the gains are no better, slowly raise the amount of volume youre doing and see where the best workouts occur. They might be at much smaller volumes than youre used to, and you might get better growth by doing less. In either case, the sweet spot is to be between your MEV and MRV, not flirting on the edges in either particular direction. 3. Getting fatigue management in line If youre not sleeping enough to be wellrested usually 79 hours per night, if intense levels of stress are killing your energy levels, and if you dont have regular times during most days to unwind, you may not be gaining at your best rates. 4. Making sure your chosen exercises have high SFRs and especially high RSMs Dont just go through the motions! If an exercise has a low SFR for you, try another one. Use movements that give you the best SFRs and the highest RSMs for lagging muscle groups so that you know youre using the best weapons for the battle. For example, it would be odd to complain about suboptimal hamstring growth if youve never even tried most of the best hamstring exercises. Be logical in your exercise selection, and always be willing to make changes to your plan as certain exercises ebb and flow between varied levels of perceived effectiveness. 5. Making sure SFR is high via the right rep ranges per muscle Some muscles get very high SFRs going heavy while other muscles seem to bene fit more from lighter training. If you notice youre experiencing crazy pumps, burns and fatigue from a given rep range and not as much from other rep ranges for a certain muscle, do the logical thing and bias a bit more of your training toward the rep range that seems most effective. For example, doing leg presses for sets of 510 might just hurt your knees and never really seem to stimulate your quads much. On the other hand, doing leg HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 60 16. Troubleshooting lack of progress presses for sets of 20 might absolutely destroy your quads in the best way pos sible. If you had never tried the higher rep range in this case, you might have erroneously written off the leg press as a low SFR exercise. In other words, be willing to explore multiple rep ranges across your movement patterns in order to identify which ones will be the most conducive for hypertrophy. 6. Being hypercaloric in gain phases and adding net bodyweight over months and years If you want to be jacked, and all of the lifters you look up to that are jacked weigh over 180 pounds, theres really no way youre going to wind up looking jacked if you only weigh 160 pounds. Unless, of course, youre in a hypercaloric condition and are actually gaining net tissue as you move up slowly to 180 pounds! Dont fall for the gaintaining folly. Instead, gain weight slowly and steadily if you want to be bigger. 7. Attending to trainingside fatigue management Training manipulations that reduce cumulative fatigue such as deloads, active rests, and lowvolume phases are critical in programming, especially when youre not a beginner anymore. A very common instant PR formula is to take a late beginner or early intermedi ate and have them do a deload or active rest for the first time. A few weeks later, theyre almost always making astonishing strength and size gains. As easy as it is to sleep on your recovery and fatigue management, properly implementing such phases is an incredible way to problemsolve any lack of progress. 8. Making all the above changes for long enough Its easy to say you tried the changes but they didnt work if you only tried to implement them for a few days or weeks. Thats kind of like jumping into a caloric deficit for four days and then saying your new diet didnt work because the scale only noted a decrease of a few tenths of a pound across your 96hour experiment. If you really want the best results, implement some of these troubleshooting tips for months and its very likely your gains will return.

HOW DO YOU CHOOSE EXERCISES? The most important principle in strength training is specificity . You train the lifts you want to get strong at so that the practice of training them makes you stronger at those specific movements. For example, if you want to improve your shoulder pressing strength, doing plenty of shoulder pressing in your training is probably a good idea. That being said, you dont only have to train the lifts you want to get stronger at by themselves. You can train other exercises that Are of a similar movement pattern to your chosen lifts An example of this would be supplementing your barbell shoulder pressing goals with a dumbbell shoulder press. Grow or make stronger certain muscles that contribute to the specific lift An example of this would be incorporating overhead extensions to make your triceps bigger and stronger for improved shoulder press strength. Make portions of the movement stronger that contribute to the specific lift. An example of this would be doing good mornings to get stronger in the squat since good mornings improve your ability to keep your back straight and upright when squatting. So when you find yourself wondering which exercises you should be using to achieve your goals, the first part of that answer will always be something to the extent of what ever is specific to the exercise itself. STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 2 1. How do you choose exercises This is the value of the principle of specificity. HOW DO YOU CHOOSE EXERCISES? Or, phrased slightly differently, the exercises you choose to feature in your training program can be the specific exercises you want to improve or exercises that train the muscles or submovements that can be known to be limiting factors to the performance of the primary exercise of focus. When we use the term limiting factors , we mean that if you improve a certain compo nent of the exercise or muscles involved, then the exercise itself will improve. An easy example is training your grip to increase your deadlift ability. If your grip strength is, in fact, limiting your ability to deadlift more weight, improving your grip strength will improve your deadlift numbers right away. STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 3 1. How do you choose exercises The second part of the answer to what exercise should I choose is simply whichever one has a higher SFR. SFR stands for stimulus to fatigue ratio . STIMULUS TO FATIGUE RATIO STIMULUS FATIGUE By stimulus, we mean an exercise that places a high degree of tension on the target muscles and is not needlessly demanding on the joints or fatiguing to the whole body as a system. Some exercises, like dips, can be a bit too unstable to place the highest possible ten sion on the target muscles and are thus best saved for muscle growth and not strength training. Other exercises, like the halfsquat for leg strength, impose a lot of stress on the spinal musculature way more than deep squats do but dont have as powerful of an ability to impose tension on the leg muscles. STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 4 1. How do you choose exercises Additionally, some exercises get very grooved in after a few sessions and are thus easy to train productively without secondguessing the movement pattern. For these exercises, we might say that they have a higher SFR than exercises that feel awkward even after youve learned to do them proficiently. Some exercises feel fine to begin with but beat up your joints and connective tissues too much, which increases overall fatigue too much and lowers the SFR. Lastly, some exercises, such as singlearm dumbbell preacher curls, are not very safe to load heavily, and thus have a poor SFR because the stimulus side high tension can never safely be presented over weeks of training. In light of all of these possibilities, what you will find is that choosing exercises that put a lot of tension on the target muscles, dont beat up the joints and connective tissues too much, are comfortable to train week after week, are safe to load heavily, and dont exhaust you entirely when you do them are the exercises with the highest SFRs and should be preferred when possible in your programming. While this is a wonderful consideration to keep in mind as a general rule, it doesnt mean you need to do only a few exercises in perpetuity. With any exercise, repeated exposures over weeks and months can cause it to turn stale, which technically means its SFR is declining. You can choose which exercises to keep in your program by abiding by the following three guidelines 1. Exercises that give you great tension and let you lift heavy relative loads naturally should be kept in most if not all cases. 2. Exercises that are easier on your joints and are worth systemic fatigue because they make you considerably stronger over time should be kept in most if not all cases. 3. Exercises that are steadily climbing in strength over months of training should be kept in most if not all cases. Conversely, you should consider replacing any exercises that 1. Are no longer grooving and leave you feeling as though youre failing to generate super high forces in the right direction. 2. Are getting tough on your joints and zap your strength for the rest of your session upon completion. 3. Have plateaued in strength over the last month or so of your training. STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 5 1. How do you choose exercises QUALIT Y TENSION, LOW JOINT FATIGUE, STEADY PROG RESSIO N STIMULUS DISPLACED TENSION, HIGH FAT IGUE, HALTED PROG RESSIO N FATIGUE Well cover this more indepth later, but there is also a timing component to exercise selection. In the beginning of a macrocycle a whole plan of strength training that ends in the testing of your 1RM, you might do mostly exercises that train subsystems and not the direct lift itself. For example, you might train lots of hack squats early in a squatfocused macrocycle to develop quad strength while doing minimal or even no squatting at all. Yet, as you near your 1RM testing day, you might do fewer subsystem exercises otherwise known as accessory or assistance movements and do lifts that mimic your 1RM lift more and more such as highbar squats and eventually the very lowbar squats youll be testing at the end. STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 6 2. WHAT IS PROPER LIFTING TECHNIQUE? Proper technique in lifting for strength has at least six unifying components, which are that the technique 1. Utilizes the most muscle possible to generate the most force. Another implication of this first point is that the technique is performed in positions in which the muscles are their strongest. For example, the sternal portion of the pectoralis muscles is bigger and stronger than the clavicular portion, so arching the back in the bench press is a better technique for strength because it allows the sternal pecs to con tribute more force to moving the bar. STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 7 2. What is proper lifting technique PROPER LIFTING TECHNIQUE Utilizes the most muscle possible to generate the most force. 2. Utilizes the leverage of the lift to move the highest loads. For example, a lowbar squat positions the bar closer to your center of gravity and thus requires less knee flexion at the bottom of the lift, which creates a shorter moment arm for the torso. In turn, this maximizes the potential to lift the heaviest weights. Another example is that good deadlift technique requires you to keep the bar as close to your legs as possible on the ascent so that the moment arm of the torso is at its lowest and higher loads can be lifted. 3. Is not needlessly fatiguing, damaging, or unsafe in the short and long term. For example, divebombing your squats can allow you to lift more, but it also magnifies injury risk substantially and makes the squat less sustainable. STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 8 2. What is proper lifting technique Candycane rounding of your lower back in the deadlift might expose the spine to deleterious forces in its most vulnerable positions and may also not be a very sustainable practice. Trying to bench press heavy with your legs up in the air can destabilize the lift and cause misgrooves of bar position that lead to injury. 4. Can be replicated session to session for tracking. The more you practice the same technique, the stronger you get at it. You should be able to remember exactly where you put your hands, hips, feet, head, etc., so you can do the lift nearly identically each time you train it. 5. Is braced and stable. Good technique nearly always features a super tight core that is achieved through proper bracing. Good technique should also feature super stable feet, shoulders, and hands. For example, this could mean creating a stable shoulder shelf by moving your scapulae back in a movement like the squat. Using sturdy shoes and chalk to make sure maximum force transfer can occur is also a good idea. 6. Meets the competitive requirements of the lift. Target lift technique must meet competition standardsrules if youre inter ested in competing. For example, if youd like to powerlift someday, you should be squatting to below parallel by default. Doing anything else from a technique perspective simply doesnt make any sense in this case due to the specificity of the goal. On the other hand, assistance lift technique Must challenge the muscle or movements being targeted. Example 1 For muscle growth work to improve strength, the chosen technique should impose a high range of motion ROM and tension on the target muscle Example 2 For submovement strength work, a proper ROM should be used to challenge the submovement. For example, creating a deep enough deficit in the deficit deadlift would be a sensible train ing idea for anyone who struggles to move the weight from the floor in the competition deadlift. STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 9 3. HOW SHOULD YOU WARM UP? Before we address the how of warming up, lets chat about the why. Specifically, what does warming up do for you? As it turns out, warming up achieves a few very beneficial things. It makes the heavy lifting done after it less likely to cause injury by warming up the tissue and practicing the lift in a safe movement path. Secondly, it makes your technique more efficient and lets you lift greater loads, which gives you a bigger stimulus and causes more strength increases. Lastly, it fires up your nervous system and lets you lift heavier loads, similarly giving you a bigger stimulus that makes you stronger. Here are some implications for how you can warm up in practice 1. You can choose to do easy cardio for 510 minutes. This is optional. 2. Begin with a 20RM weight for the first exercise and do it for around 10 reps. 3. Do at least one weight halfway between your 20RM weight and your planned working weight for a set of five reps or so. The heavier the lift, the more sets of 8,6,4, etc. you might need to do. 050 pounds 1 intermediate set 50200 pounds 2 intermediate sets 200400 pounds 3 intermediate sets Continue this trend as needed for bigger weights. STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 10 3. How should you warm up 4. Do the working weight itself or 90 of it for 12 reps. This is generally the last warm up set before the first working set and is also referred to as the potentia tion set because it potentiates your nervous system to produce its highest output and lets you use mostall of your strength on the upcoming working set. When warming up, you should aim to execute the exact lifting technique bracing and all for every single warm up rep, even if it looks silly. As the saying goes, practice like you play! As you progress through your training session, the abovedescribed warm up protocol can be shortened a bit if the next lift is for a similar movement pattern. Heres an example of how you might warm up to doing squats for sets of five Warm Up Set 1 45 pounds for 10 reps Warm Up Set 2 135 pounds for 6 reps Warm Up Set 3 225 pounds for 4 reps Warm Up Set 4 275 pounds for 2 reps Potentiation Set 300 pounds for 1 rep Then you would begin your working sets of 5 reps at 300 pounds.

How should you warm up 45 LBS FOR 10 REPS WORKING SETS AT 300 LBSCHOOSE GRAIN AND HEALTHY FAT OPTIONSSQUAT S WITH A WORKIN G WEIGHT OF 300 POUND S 135 LBS FOR 6 REPS 225 LBS FOR 4 REPS 275 LBS FOR 2 REPS 300 LBS FOR 1 REP 12 MINUTE REST BETWEEN WARMUPS Later, if you were to do front squats for 5s at 250lbs after your squatting at 300lbs, you might truncate your front squat warm up to the following Warm Up Set 1 135 pounds for 5 reps Warm Up Set 2 225 pounds for 3 reps Warm Up Set 3 250 pounds for 1 rep Then you would begin your working sets at 250 pounds. STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 12 4. HOW HEAVY SHOULD YOU LIFT? From a large combination of scientific research and practical insight, we can be relatively certain that strength training is best done at a certain percentage of your 1RM, otherwise known as a loading range or relative intensity. From this combination of research and practice, we know that lifting anything less than 80 of your 1RM can improve your strength but wont be very efficient per working set. In other words, youd have to do a lot of lighter sets to get as strong as just a few heavy sets could make you at a fraction of time investment and fatigue cost. Such lighter training can cause lots of muscle growth but isnt heavy enough to cause the best strength gains via nervous system adaptations. On the other hand, lifting anything over 92.5 of your 1RM also improves strength but not very efficiently per working set. In this case, youd need a ton of sets to cause a lot of strength improvement. Thats not just a poor use of time, but it also would likely cause lots more joint and connective tissue fatigue and even increase your risk of acute injury. Such ultraheavy training is essential for proper peaking of strength before a competition but not ideal for its core development. We can develop some rational loading recommendations by taking all of this under advisement. STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 13 4. How heavy should you lift RATIONAL LOADING RECOMMENDATIONS 1. Anything in the 8092.5 range of your 1RM will cause great strength gains, which typically means doing challenging sets of roughly 36 reps. This doesnt mean you have to do exactly 8092.5. People are different! The key is to find your challenging loads for sets of 36 reps because thats likely where youll build the most strength. Keep in mind too that you might need a bit more or less than 8092.5 1RM to challenge yourself with sets of 36 reps. 2. Some assistance work is best suited toward slightly higher reps such as sets of 58 reps, especially if the exercises are sin glejoint moves such as skull crushers or lateral raises. This is for direct strength training because growing muscle for eventual strength development is best done with sets of 510 reps. Well explore that in more depth later on. To keep things super simple, follow these guidelines to adjust your loads If you can do easy sets of 7 reps, its too light. If you cant do a few sets of at least 3 reps in a row, its too heavy. Thats it! STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 14 5. HOW LONG SHOULD YOU REST BETWEEN SETS? Okay, so now you know how heavy to go for each working set. But how many reps you can get in each set is hugely based on how long you rest between each set and the next, which begs the question Is there a correct amount of time to rest between sets? Yes, there is! After a given working set, you should rest long enough until you can at least check the following boxes for yourself 1. Your prime movers are no longer burning, crampy, or drained. 2. Your cardio will not be the limiting factor in your next set. 3. Your nervous systempsychology will not be the limiting factor on your next set. In other words, you feel strong enough to hit your target reps with the given load. 4. No synergists will be the limiting factor on your next set. STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 15 5.

DO YOU FEEL STRONG ENOUGH TO PERFORM WELL? ARE OTHER ASSISTANCE MUSCLE GROUPS RECOVERED?YES YES YES Because your performance on each working set determines how much of a strength stimulus youll benefit from, You can always tell the competitive weightlifters and powerlifters apart from everyone else at the gym because they rest so much longer than they actually lift. STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 16 5. How long should you rest between sets Lets see how this checklist system would play out with an example of you doing sets of five at 500 pounds if your rough 1RM were around 585 pounds. 1. Your prime movers are no longer burning, crampy, or drained. 60 seconds 2. Your cardio will not limit you on the next set. Two minutes 3. Your nervous systempsychology will not limit you on the next set. Five minutes 4. No synergists will limit you on the next set. 60 seconds In this case, because your nervous system and psychology needed five minutes, thats how long you should take to rest at minimum, no matter how long the other factors took to satisfy. Now, lets see how much rest youd need if you lifted 350 pounds for sets of five instead of 500 pounds if you had the same strength. 1. Your prime movers are no longer burning, crampy, or drained. 45 seconds 2. Your cardio will not limit you on the next set. 90 seconds 3. Your nervous systempsychology will not limit you on the next set. 60 seconds 4. No synergists will limit you on the next set. 45 seconds STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 17 5. How long should you rest between sets The result is 90 seconds, which doesnt mean you have to do another set again as soon as that time elapses. Rather, it means that you should rest at least 90 seconds. If you have a limited amount of time in the gym that day, resting the 90second minimum might be whats required to move through your session at an appropriate pace to finish. But, if youre not battling the clock, you might choose to rest two or even three minutes between sets simply to make the session feel less rushed. STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 18 6. HOW MANY SETS SHOULD YOU DO? To answer this question, you have to answer it in two ways. The first way to answer this question is to consider how many sets you should do per movement type like a squat, a hinge, or a press per session. The second way to answer this question is to consider how many total working sets you should do per session , which includes all movement types in that session combined. Lets answer them one at a time. HOW MANY SETS TO TRAIN PER MOVEMENT When training a given movement in a given session, you need to do enough sets of it to drive best strength adaptations, which means at least one heavy working set per session. In addition, the number of sets you do in your last week of a progression before taking a weeklong break to recover known as a deload should be close to the most work that you can recover from and benefit from, because any less would be a missed opportunity in most cases. Thus, if you could have benefitted from five sets of squats but you only did four, you left some strength on the table. You do want to push the limits, but not exceed them. If you do so many sets in a session that the last set fails to perform highly enough to meet minimum force requirements, that last set was a set too far. So, how do you know if youre underperforming? STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 19 6. How many sets should you do Heres a quick reference guide for the three different types of training youll do in an advanced strength training program For hypertrophy for strength development , you know that you are underperforming when you cant do sets of 5 to 10 with at least about 75 of your 1RM. For basic strength development , you know you are underperforming when you cant do sets of 3 to 6 with at least 82.5 of your 1RM. For limit strength development , you know that you are underper forming when you cant do sets of 1 to 3 with at least about 87.5 of your 1RM. HYPERTROPHY FOR STRENGTHBASIC STRENGTHLIMIT STRENGTH 510 reps with at least 75 1RM36 reps with at least 82.5 1RM13 reps with at least 87.5 1RMLOADING STANDARDS FOR STRENGTH TRAINING In essence, if you fail to perform to those minimum standards, youre so fatigued that youre moving weight around without stimulating much of anything. This sort of junk volume is going to accumulate to result in tons of fati gue but very little improvement and is something you should actively avoid. STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 20 6. How many sets should you do In essence, if you fail to perform to those minimum standards, youre so fatigued that youre moving weight around without stimulating much of anything. This sort of junk volume is going to accumulate to result in tons of fatigue but very little improvement and is something you should actively avoid. Youve also done too much work in a given session if you cannot recover to perform better in the next weeks concomitant session. For example, if you hit a PR of 230 pounds for a top set of five reps last week and then did lots of other work sets after, you had better not have done so many sets after that next week youre too fatigued to do at least something like 235 pounds for a top set of five reps. Because if youre getting so tired that you literally cannot progress in strength, how in the world are you going to, well, progress in strength?! Often but not always, another sign that you might be doing too much volume is that youre still sore in the muscles you trained last time by the next time you are scheduled to train them again. For example, if you have a squat and SLDL session on Monday and a deadlift and hack squat session on Thursday but youre still sore in your lower back and quads by Thursday, youre probably doing too much on Monday. Strength training is about going hard in the gym and coming back recovered enough to go even harder next time. Its not just about leaving it all on the gym floor every time. In fact, many would consider that a wellintentioned but careless beginner mistake. To keep it simpler, we could refine these ideas down to the following points 1. If youre not training very close to your heaviest, its not going to make you much stronger. 2. If youre training so much that you cant hit a PR in the next week, youre training too much. 3. If youre training so much that youre still sore by the next session, youre training too much. 4. If you deload when you could have set another PR in the next week, you should be training with more sets per session or longer accumulation phases. STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 21 6. How many sets should you do Lastly, remember that permovement volume includes sets from all exercises of a given movement pattern. So if you have three sets of bench presses and three sets of incline dumbbell presses, thats six sets for the pressing movement, not just three. Be sure to keep that in mind as you do your best to make sense of specific volume numbers as they relate to your ability to recover and progress effectively across your training cycle. HOW MANY SETS TO TRAIN PER SESSION Now that permovement volume is sorted, how many sets in total should you be doing per session? First, if any of the exercises fall much below the 75, 82.5 or 87.5 lines for their respective 1RM zones, its probably best practice to discontinue that session since doing anything more than that is likely junk volume even if it feels heavy. It can feel heavy just because youre tired, not because its challenging your body to get stronger. For example, if you cant hit a set of three with more than 82.5 of your fresh 1RM for an exercise, youre probably very fatigued and should shut the session down. The implication here is that you can only do so much work in a given strength training session before youre too tired to continue being productive. Typically, this results in some common numbers for most people to expect to come close to as they near their capabilities. For most lifters, between 2 and 5 sets per movement type per session seems to work best. And, much more than 15 heavy work sets in a total session drops most below the minimum loading thresholds and is thus excessive. STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 22 6.

For many, it can be difficult to understand what exactly hard means in the context of strength training. When we use the term, we are suggesting that hard training means training close to your maximum abilities if you were to push each set to your absolute limits. But, what does the research say? Generally, it suggests that going all out shows no clear benefit over going very hard with some force in reserve. Going all out which is here defined as giving a maximum effort on every set all the time causes a lot of fatigue accumulation, which can prevent you from stringing together as many great workouts in a row as you could. On the other hand, training very far from your limits causes very poor gains. So the question then becomes the following How can you make sure you give hard, but not excessive effort to each working set? For this question, we find it most helpful to use the Rating of Perceived Exertion, or RPE scale, which states the following RPE 7 That was tough, but I very comfortably hit the goal weight and reps. RPE 8 That was very tough, but I had no problem hitting the goal weight and reps. RPE 9 That was super tough and a real struggle to hit the goal weight and reps. RPE 10 If there was so much as one extra pound on the bar, I would have missed my goal weight and reps no matter how hard I tried. STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 24 7.

In most cases, something similar to the following example will prove beneficial for most lifters. 1. Start most accumulation phases 12 months of systematic progres sions in both load and effort before a deload week at your best estimate of RPE 7 and write down your weight and reps. 2. Add weight each week while trying to match reps from last week. Week 1 100 lbs for 5, 5, 5 RPE 7ish Week 2 105 lbs for 5, 5, 5 RPE 8ish Week 3 110 lbs for 5, 5, 5 RPE 9ish Week 4 115 lbs for 5, 5, 5 RPE 10ish 3. Sooner or later, you will hit failure and not be able to get your target reps. At that point it will be time to take a break and restart the process stronger than you were when you began the first phase. Week 5 120lbs for 5, 5, 4 last set of 5 a miss at RPE 10 Week 6 Deload training to recover and prepare for a second training cycle. STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 25 8. HOW OFTEN SHOULD YOU TRAIN? Similar to the section on volume, we have to answer this question both for each move ment type and for the total number of training sessions in the week. As a bit of a recap, remember that movement type refers to broader interpretations of human movement patterns such as a squatting motion, a hinging motion, a pressing motion, or a pulling motion. Generally, you can train the same movement type again later in the week when you can add load to the bar and successfully complete your target reps. This is also done best when the muscles involved have healed from last times imposed soreness. How often that is depends on how hard you train each session. STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 26 8. How often should you train TIMEPERFORMANCE STIMULUSADAPTATION RECOVERY HOMEOSTATIC DISRUPTIONTRAIN AGAIN HEREHOW OFTEN SHOULD YOU TRAIN? For example, if you do three sets per session, this might mean four sessions per week. But if you do four sets per session, this might mean three sessions per week. In most cases, anything under 24 sets per session might best be combined into fewer sessions since its just not worth the time and fatigue of warming up that many times per week. On the other hand, most movement types of more than 8 sets per session should be split up to increase the amount of weight lifted in your average set and thus increase the strength stimulus. Most often, the result is that a permovement frequency of 24x per muscle per week is great depending on individual recovery rates and how demanding each session is. Higher frequencies are possible in some cases, but they should be done for limited periods of time due to the risk of unsustainability over months of training. STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 27 8. How often should you train The total number of sessions per week that can be done hinges first and foremost on adherence. To help you make sense of your own training frequency, utilize this guide based on training age. For the purposes of this guide, we consider beginners as people who have trained for strength for 03 years, intermediates as those who have trained for 37 years, and advanced athletes as those who have been training for more than seven years. TRAINING FREQUENCY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR BEGINNER, INTERMEDIATE, AND ADVANCED ATHLETES Beginners 24 total sessions per week The most important thing to consider with beginners is that you dont want to burn them out in the process. In fact, you want to ignite desire for more! Additionally, nearly all beginners will make incredible progress on very low frequencies. And in most cases, full body training splits will be featured on these lower frequencies. Intermediates 36 total sessions per week Intermediates are unlikely to burn out because theyve already proven to love the training process. At this point, they need more sessions to do each movement justice. This is where more complicated splits like pushpulllegs, upperlower, etc. become more common. STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 28 8. How often should you train Advanced 510 total sessions per week For advanced athletes, each movement needs to be first in its session at least once a week to improve as optimally as possible. In fact, training only one or two movements per session is very common as much more can often lead into junk volume territory. Additionally, emphasis and deemphasis can be employed for those who can only train 56 days per week. This means that such lifters might focus on squats and deadlifts for a few months while bench pressing stays at maintenance done last in sessions and with only enough volume and load to maintain performance but not improve it, and then switch later to emphasizing squats and benches while dead lifting stays at maintenance. Finally, twicedaily sessions can take you up to 10 sessions per week total if desired, but this is almost reserved for competitors or those who might consider themselves hardcore. STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 29 9. HOW SHOULD YOU PROGRESS? When you begin an accumulation phase in any given mesocycle, you need to choose a weight for each exercise in its target rep range, which is generally 510 for strengthfocused hypertrophy mesocycles 36 for basic strength mesocycles 13 for limit strengthpeaking mesocycles From here, the idea is to program enough sets for each movement type so that you estimate that youll reach your maximum ability to recover your maximum recoverable volume or MRV at the end of the accumulation phase. This, however, is certainly a skill to be developed, so simply make your best guess to start. After a few mesocycles, youll know your body well enough to make increasingly educated estimations of your MRV. If youre very unsure, its better to be conservative and err on the side of underestimating your MRV rather than overestimating your MRV. Once youve estimated your MRV and written out your programming accordingly, its time to start lifting and progressing. As we mentioned before, its probably best practice to start your accumulation phases with weights that land you in your target rep range at an RPE 7 for the first week. STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 30 9. How should you progress Write down your weight and reps for each set in every session. Then, for your second week of training, come back and add enough weight to keep the RPE the same or raise it by one. For example Week 1 100 pounds for 5 reps at RPE 7 Week 2 110 pounds for for 5 reps at RPE 8 A hard rule here is that your next week needs to beat your performance from last week. Beating your performance, in this case, could mean improving it by a small margin at the same RPE or by more but only as much as 1 RPE higher. In other words, dont make an aggressive jump from RPE 7 to RPE 10 in a single week! If you get to your last week of training before you deload and youre completely fatigued to the extent that there is no way you can hit another PR next week, thats great! Youre right around your MRV and your volume estimations are on point. On the other hand, if you feel like you can probably PR again even if only by a little next week because youre just not that fatigued, deload anyway but raise the average volume number of sets for that movement type in your next mesocycle by a set and repeat this process. STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 31 10. WHEN AND HOW SHOULD YOU DELOAD? As you add weight and potentially sets to your sessions from week to week, you will inevitably reach the point of being unable to beat your performance from the week prior. When this happens, you will need to respond with some form of implemented recovery protocol. If this happens to just one of the movement patterns you have in your program but not the others, you can simply deploy a recovery session. Heres how to do that 1. Finish the session strong. 2. In the next planned session for that movement and muscle group, do all the planned sets at the planned reps but at half of the planned weight. For example, if you were supposed to bench press 240 pounds for 9, 8, 7, 6, you would bench press 120 pounds for 9, 8, 7, 6 instead. 3. Resume the sessions in the week after at the same number of planned sets and keep progressing as you were in weight. If we keep the same example from our second point, this means the week following your recovery session would be the time to attempt 240 pounds for 9, 8, 7, 6. 4. Add weight from there as you normally would. STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 32 10. When and how should you deload Recovery sessions like this can buy you another week or two of progression by reducing your fatigue. Its certainly an effective strategy, but it will only carry you so far since the fatigue from your other movements will still be accumulating all the while. At some point, after about 36 weeks of training in most cases, several of your trained movement patterns will require recovery sessions. And eventually, your entire mind and body will feel beat up, your persession RPEs will be crazy high, and you will begin to underperform fail to beat last weeks numbers on nearly all of your movements at the same time. As you approach these colliding levels of fatigue, you will need to bring both your sys temic and localized fatigue back down significantly by deloading. To deload, do the following for one whole week 1. In the first half of the week, do the same number of sets and reps as the week before but at only 70 of last weeks weight. 2. In the second half of the week, do the same number of sets and reps as the week before, but at only 50 of last weeks weight. This should clear enough fatigue to allow you to train hard for another whole mesocycle. After your deload week, follow instructions from section nine of this guide and begin climbing your way up to higher training volumes once again. STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 33 11. HOW SHOULD YOU PLAN TRAINING PHASES? As weve already demonstrated, productive training happens best by making each suc cessive week systematically harder. And, when you can string multiple weeks of productive training together, this is called an accumulation phase . As we just learned, a deload week is what you deploy to drop the fatigue that accumu lates during your accumulation phase, and the two together an accumulation phase plus a deload week make up what we refer to as a mesocycle . As we move up the timescale, anywhere from 13 mesocycles of the same kind of train ing add up to what we call a block of training. At this point in the guide, weve already alluded to there being 3 primary types of training blocks, but now is the time to discuss them in a more explicit, detailed format. 3 SPECIFIC KINDS OF TRAINING HYPERTROPHY FOR STRENGTH PURPOSES This kind of training is accomplished through sets of 510 reps. These should be exercises that grow the most muscle but also convert well to strength moves. This kind of training allows for slightly higher training volumes. STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 34 11. How should you plan training phases BASIC STRENGTH Basic strength training should be accomplished through sets of 36 reps. These should be exercises that increase strength the most and are very similar to or the same as competitiongoal exercises. This kind of training allows for normal strength training volumes as discussed in earlier sections of this guide. PEAKING This kind of training is accomplished through sets of 13 reps. Sets of 36 reps at RPEs of 36 can also be done for technique work between hard sessions. In terms of exercise selection, these should be mostly if not exclusively competition exercises. When peaking, intensities should range from RPE 7 to RPE 9. In the final week of peaking, RPEs should range from 36. Volume in a peaking phase declines during most weeks. Essentially, during a peaking phase, your volume progresses from normal strength volumes to no training at all as you prepare to max out and set a new PR. SEQUENCING TRAINING BLOCKS Most strength training macrocycles are sequenced as follows a hypertrophy block, then a strength block, then a peaking block. They are ordered like this because of the principle of phase potentiation , which is the idea that, for best longterm performances, certain training qualities need to be STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 35 11. How should you plan training phases developed ahead of others since the latter qualities are based on the former. The former qualities potentiate, or improve, the end result of the latter qualities. In strength training, we potentiate strength phases with hypertrophy phases because, if you build more muscle first, you have more muscle to make stronger. Then, the peaking phase follows the strength phase because it doesnt make any sense to peak your strength if you havent dedicated yourself to a season of improving your strength in the first place. By analogy, the hypertrophy phase is like the underground foundation of a skyscraper, the strength phase is like the main floors, and the peaking phase is like the spire at the top. To build the tallest skyscraper you can, you need to focus on building a sturdy base to support the main floors to come. If you fail to build a solid base, not as many main floors can be built above ground with stability. Once you have the main floors on top of the base, only then do you add the spire on top. A spire placed on ground level doesnt make for a very impressive structure. Without a spire, the skyscraper is primarily made up of its main floors. It might be relatively tall and impressive, but it will never be as grand and aweinspiring as would be with a spire. In strength training terms, phase potentiation looks like this 1. Put on muscle through the use of a hypertrophy block. 2. Make that new muscle stronger through the use of a basic strength block. 3. Peak for max performance through the use of a peaking block. 4. Compete or max out at the gym. 5. Take an active rest phase, which is essentially 12 weeks of super easy training or even no formal training at all to heal both physically and psychologically for the next macrocycle of training. 6. And then repeat! STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 36 11.

If youre not yet ready or interested in competition, you dont have to peak if you dont want to. You can just do hypertrophy and strength blocks back to back with an active rest on occasion to get amazing longterm strength gains. After all, you can always incorporate a peaking phase if you decide youre ready to enter into the competitive realm of strength sport. STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 37 12. BEGINNER VS. INTERMEDIATE VS. ADVANCED TRAINING Different training approaches can change based on your level of advancement in lifting. The key is to figure out which category applies to you. Beginner You just lift and you keep getting stronger automatically without much complexity. You get stronger every single mesocycle of training. Youre most likely to have lifted for 03 years, though if the above two points apply to you, youre still a beginner even more than 3 years into your lifting career. Intermediate Youve hit your first plateau and had to navigate around it. You need to nail the basics consistently to keep progressing. You get a little stronger in most mesocycles of training, but, on occasion, you have a mesocycle or two where no clear evidence of strength gain is present, especially during hypertrophy blocks. Youre most likely to have lifted for 37 years, though it could be less or more. STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 38 12. Beginner vs. Intermediate vs. Advanced Training Advanced If your sleep, recovery, nutrition, and training isnt meticulous and wellplanned, you simply dont make strength gains. You actually temporarily decline in predicted 1RM strength during hypertrophy blocks, regain the lost strength early on in strength mesocycles, gain perhaps a little bit of predicted strength in your last strength mesocycle of the strength block, and make most of your apparent gains in your peaking phase. Youre most likely to have lifted for 7 years, though it could be less or more. If youre not sure which one you are, choose the less experienced of your two best choices and go from there. Once youve made your choice, or, if you train other individuals who are of a certain advancement in their training age, you can incorporate some of the following training recommendations for each level Beginner athletes should 1. Do mostly sets of 510 reps. 2. Focus mostly on the compound basics or just a few basic exercises. 3. Focus tons on improving and solidifying their technique. 4. Avoid training at RPE 10 as the technique breakdown here can cause the accidental learning of bad technique. 5. Avoid nearMRV volumes. 6. Train fullbody 34x per week. STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 39 12. Beginner vs. Intermediate vs. Advanced Training Intermediate athletes should 1. Do mostly sets of 510 and sets of 36 while peaking with sets of 13 but not peaking too often. 2. Try lots of different exercises to see which SFRs are best for them. 3. Focus on altering their basic techniques to fit their personal SFRs. 4. Push from RPE 710 in most mesocycles while focusing on breaking barriers toward the end of each mesocycles. 5. Train from MEV to MRV in most mesocycles. 6. Train each movement type 24x per week across 46 total sessions. Advanced athletes should 1. Do mostly sets of 36 while only utilizing sets of 510 when needing to reclaim size or move up a weight class. 2. Focus mostly on the best SFR exercises for them. Advanced athletes should vary their rep ranges and move ments to manage fatigue within the week. 3. Perform most of their training between RPE 89. Unfortunately, RPE 7 might be too easy for advanced athletes to get their best gains from. Training to an RPE 10 is permissible, but it should be on rare occasions because of the very high levels of fatigue and potential for injury it generates. STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 40 12. Beginner vs. Intermediate vs. Advanced Training 4. Train each movement pattern 23x per week across 510 ses sions with twiceperday sessions used in a phasic manner over the block. Due to such high degrees of strength in some advanced athletes, they often cant do too many sets in one session productively.

HOW DO YOU PRIORITIZE SPECIFIC LIFTS? You may want to prioritize specific lifts for an additional increase in strength, but you must understand that such prioritization always results in a tradeoff between different lifts. When you focus intensely on one or several lifts at a time, you can certainly expect to improve your gains for those specific exercises, but the consequence is that you will inevitably make less progress or even just maintain strength among the exercises you are forced to place on the back burner. Unfortunately, theres no way to magically maximize all of your lifts at the same time. That being said, if youre willing to accept the pros and cons of specialization phases, here is the best way to do it in six concise points. 1. Firstly, do a hypercaloric hypertrophy phase for the supporting muscles of the movements you intend to isolate. Remember, the best way to improve your per formance in the bench press is to grow bigger triceps and a bigger chest. 2. Train the prioritized lift or the muscles that support it more often, usually with one extra session per week more than usual. For example, if you normally squat 2x per week and you want to prioritize squats, try to reconfigure your program in a way that allows you to squat 3x per week. 3. Train other lifts and muscle groups with less volume. This is especially relevant if the muscles are used heavily in both lifts. For example, if you want to increase your bench press, you might need STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 42 13. How do you prioritize specific lifts to reduce your shoulder pressing volume since both of those movements heavily recruit the shoulders and the triceps. 4. Train the prioritized lift first in most of its weekly sessions. If you say you want to prioritize your deadlift, but you always train it after squatting, you have a conflict of interest. 5. Consider training it the hardest after each weeks days off. For example, if you always take Sundays off, its probably a good idea to train your movement of emphasis first and hardest on Mondays. 6. Choose the exercises that have the highest RSM. And, although you should cer tainly consider the SFRs for these same movements, its probably best practice to prioritize exercises with the best RSMs and work around the resulting fatigue. In case that acronym is new to you, RSM stands for raw stimulus magnitude , and it represents only the stimulus portion of the SFR, not the fatigue portion. Thus, if deficit deadlifts really boost your deadlift but also result in an enormous amount of systemic fatigue, it makes good sense to keep them in if youre prioritizing your deadlift, but you might have to lower your heavy squatting and overall posterior chain volume enough in other areas of your program to make room for them. STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 43 14. PREVENTING AND MANAGING INJURIES As important as it is to be aware of injury prevention, youll never be able to make the gym a completely safe place to be. Steel is heavy and hard, and when it falls, sometimes people get hurt. But, you can reduce your chance of injury by implementing a few basic training ideas. Here are four of our best tips on how to do just that while training for strength. 4 TIPS FOR INJURY PREVENTION IN STRENGTH TRAINING Dont be an idiot. Always be sure to warm up properly, and keep your technique clean. Avoid gym challenges and random heavy lifting. Dont lift any loads you havent worked up to in a calculated, progressive manner. This point is huge! Tons of people have gotten hurt by reaching way beyond the loads they should have been lifting when all they needed to do was wait another several weeks of progression. STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 44 14. Preventing and Managing Injuries Ramp up loads slowly. As you add weight to the bar from week to week, never add so much weight that you have to increase more than one point on the RPE scale from the week prior. In most cases, you will be going up by 5, 10, or 15 pounds. Dont be silly and slap an extra 45 pounds on the bar because you feel like it. Being patient will notably reduce your injury risk. Dont train with overlapping soreness often as training with microdamage may predispose you to injury. If you train with overlapping soreness on occasion, dont add any more sets to the session youre doing or to the one before its next weeks equivalent so that youre not doing more when you already cant recover from doing the current prescription. Pay attention. If some technique hurts your joints more and more with each rep or set, pause the set, rack the weight, reevaluate, and make adjustments if it continues. STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 45 14. Preventing and Managing Injuries Deload maturely. Dont skip the deload or cut it short! Deloads can be boring, but your body needs them to literally heal. Skipping or cutting a deload short is essentially asking for trouble. Dont add work during your deload cause youre itching to train. Deloads are supposed to be easy and lowvolume. If your deload isnt super easy, its not much of a deload. Instead, its just another week of hard training where your fatigue doesnt really decline much in preparation for the next mesocycle. This will cause fatigue to accumulate much faster than anticipated in that next mesocycle, which will inevitably cause problems including but not limited to an increased risk of injury. Hopefully, you take all of this insight into account and never wind up getting hurt to the extent that your training quality and intensity is negatively impacted. But, because the nature of strength training is one of overload and pushing beyond your limits with increasingly heavy weights, injury for almost everyone at some point in the game is nearly inevitable. If and when you do get hurt, please give the following steps a look before you make your next move. As a bit of a bonus consideration, please remember that when youve injured a specific muscle or joint but still want to train other muscles, you have to make sure none of the other training bothers the injured area to any noticeable extent. In doing this, you will avoid continuously reaggravating the injury without letting it heal completely. STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 46 14. Preventing and Managing Injuries 6 STEPS FOR INJURY MANAGEMENT IN STRENGTH TRAINING For the injured area itself 1. See a medical professional and do all the surgeryrehabtime away they instruct. 2. When youre cleared for activity, start with sets of 2030 reps at 510 RIR and work on range of motion. You can end this phase of training when you can per form the entire range of motion of the movementjoint painfree 3. Once the injured area is painfree in normal ranges of motion, work up to doing 30 RIR in just a handful of sets of 2030 reps in several sessions across the week. Recently injured tissues have very poor volume tolerance, so doing a bit fewer sets like 12 per session 23x per week is better than doing more sets like 34 sets per session 34x per week. 4. After this, add sets and cycle from MEV to MRV in the 2030 rep range. This can be done once youre very comfortably recovering from just a few sets of 2030 reps. 5. Once youve spent some time training comfortably and painfree in the higher rep ranges, slowly add load to some of those sets to get into the 1020 rep range. Add load slowly and let the reps fall by two or so per session. In other words, dont just jump from your 30RM to 10RM unless you want to get hurt again. 6. From here, keep slowly adding load, and eventually dip back into the 510 rep range. Once youve been able to train in that range effectively for a few weeks, take a deload and then proceed into your strength and peaking rep ranges as you see fit. STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 47 14.

STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 48 15. MATCHING YOUR TRAINING TO YOUR DIET Diet is a big factor in how well your strength training improves your abilities, and making sure youre dieting the right way for the phase of strength training youre in can be a major contributor to your success. If youre trying to gain muscle by eating in a caloric surplus, only do this during a hyper trophy block. Otherwise, youll put on a needless amount of fat. If youre dieting to lose fat and potentially enter a lower weight class, youre best off doing this during your hypertrophy blocks as well. You can diet down during early strength phases in your strength blocks, but its highly recommended that you never exceed a rate of loss of greater than 0.5 body weight per week to minimize risking strength losses. If you diet down during such strength phases, make sure to also reduce your load pro gressions from week to week by about half of their usual amounts so that you dont accumulate too much fatigue and overreach prematurely. Weight loss dieting makes fatigue reduction way harder, and you have to take this into account! Think of it as driving in the snow. You either slow down so that you dont swerve reck lessly off the road, or you dont slow down and wind up in a ditch or worse. The trip goes slower when you take the necessary precautions to account for the snow, but it goes faster than any alternate situation in which you drive off the road and waste time being stuck in a snowbank waiting for help. STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 49 15. Matching Your Training to Your Diet Furthermore, if our analogous car flips and you get injured because youve been carrying excessive levels of fatigue from dieting while pushing loads too quickly in a strength phase, then youve got more problems than just a slightly delayed trip. In later phases in your strength block, you should be maintaining your weight, and you should nearly always maintain your weight during peaking phases to make sure youre used to lifting in a body that has the same leverages over time and isnt fatigued from weight loss dieting right at the point when fatigue reduction is most critically important. Yes, you can lose weight in the last days or hours of your meet prep by cutting water, but you should not be losing weight in the last weeks of meet prep by cutting calories. STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 50 16. TROUBLESHOOTING LACK OF PROGRESS There could be many reasons youre not seeing the strength gains you want or the gains youre used to seeing. The most common reason is that youre still expecting linear gains like you made when you were a beginner. But, because youre more advanced, you should actually be expect ing gains of diminishing returns. The second biggest reason you might not be getting the gains you want is simply genet ics. Not all of us were built to bench press 500 pounds, which is certainly unfortunate, but it isnt exactly a Shakespearean tragedy. That being said, if youve made peace with your training age and your genetics, there may be some additional factors to consider that could improve your rate of strength gains, especially if youve hit an unexplained plateau. 8 FACTORS FOR TROUBLESHOOTING A LACK OF STRENGTH IMPROVEMENT 1. Appropriate and consistent training and diet If youre inconsistent, the inconsistency is the problem with your gains. You will only see your best gains when youre able to piece together tidy sequences of completed workouts over weeks and months. STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 51 16. Troubleshooting Lack of Progress 2. MEV to MRV training for each muscle group targeted For example, do you even know if youre hitting your MRV at the end of your squat accumulation phases? If youve never taken your squat training volume high enough to stall squat strength out, you dont actually know. They might benefit from much more volume than youre currently training them with, and no amount of extra intensity will make up for that. You can do squat 1RMs until youre blue in the face, but what you probably need is just more sets of 36 reps. Are these sets of 36 as exciting? Maybe not. But they are very effective in the longterm. If you feel as though you might be undertraining a lift, increase the number of sets every mesocycle of a block and pay attention to where your strength gains are best. Please remember that you find out the strength gains in the tested mesocycle by seeing how strong you are for reps in the mesocycle after it, not in the mesocycle itself. Only after a deload brings the fatigue down can you see if your experiment worked. On the other hand, you might be smashing your bench press with nearMRV or even above MRV volumes. In this case, you can reduce the amount of training you do for your pressing movements by one set per mesocycle in a given block and see at which volumes your rep strength goes up the most. You can use this process for any movement type, but you have to make sure that each movement type is completely accounted for. If you lower your bench pressing volume but raise your machine pressing volume at the same time, youre not actually lowering your total pressing volumes. 3. Getting fatigue management in line If youre not sleeping enough to be wellrested 79 hours, if high levels of stress are killing your energy levels, and if you dont have regular times during most days and pretty much all weeks to unwind, you may not be gaining at your best rates. Rest and recovery are incredibly important when it comes to making your best strength gains. STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 52 16. Troubleshooting Lack of Progress 4. Making sure your chosen exercises have high SFRs and high RSMs Dont be the athlete who simply goes through the motions. If an exercise has a low SFR for you, try another one. Use movements that give you the best SFRs and the highest RSMs for really lagging muscle groups and movement types so that you know youre using the best weapons for the battle. It would be strange to complain about lagging squat strength if you have yet to try increasing your hack squats for sets of 510 reps in your hypertrophy phase even though you get a Grady stimulus from hack squats. 5. Finding a stable technique for each lift that works best for your biggest numbers Some people prefer to bench press with a wider grip while others prefer to bench press with a narrower grip. Similarly, some people prefer sumo deadlifting, some conventional, and many others prefer various styles that seem to account for everything in between. Your technique doesnt have to look like someone elses, but it should feel best for you. As you practice it over time, you should become very comfortable with it, which is likely to lead to your best gains. Think of it this way. If you havent been progressing on a lift, what do you have to lose by experimenting with a slightly different technique? Strength regain is very easy compared to new gain, so at worst youll just be in the same spot after your experiment. At best, youll see improvements! 6. Being hypercaloric in gain phases and adding net bodyweight over months years To become the strongest version of yourself, you have to get more muscular. If you look at almost all of the champion lifters in most weight classes over history, they are megajacked! No, you might not have signed up explicitly for hypertrophy work when you chose to pursue strength training, but its undeniable that big muscles create big forces. So, if you want to get stronger, the most straightfor ward way to do it by far is to add muscle size. STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 53 16. Troubleshooting Lack of Progress Unless youre already very lean for your weight class and you dont want to move up, adding size is a very good idea in nearly every case for serious strength athletes. 7. Attending to trainingside fatigue management Training manipulations that reduce cumulative fatigue such as deloads, active rests, and lowvolume phases are critical in programming, especially when youre no longer a beginner. A very common instant PR formula is to take a late beginner or early intermedi ate and have them do a deload or active rest for the first time. In most cases, a few weeks later youll notice that they are making crazy strength gains. Weird, right? Its almost as if bringing down fatigue is a good thing that potentiates further strength gains! 8. Making all the above changes for long enough Its easy to say you tried the changes but they didnt work if you only tried to implement them for a few days or even a few weeks. But, if you really want the best results, try implementing some of these trouble shooting tips for months. At that point, its very likely that the gains will return! Unfortunately, too many people are simply unwilling to make this kind of tempo rarily thankless commitment in order to set themselves up for future success. If you can resist that temptation, however, youll give yourself the chance to push your limits further than you ever have before.

Medical professionals use a measurement called body mass index BMI, to work out which of four categories you fall into underweight, ideal weight, overweight or obese. Your BMI is calculated using your weight and height measurements.

Ive lost 6cm off my waist and I can fit into trousers I havent worn for years. Rif lost 13lb and 6cm off his waistARE YOU A HEALTHY SHAPE ? As well as checking your BMI it is also important to measure your waist size. Your shape, as much as your weight, can affect your health risk. Fat around your middle can increase your risk of getting heart disease, cancer and type 2 diabetes. Thats because these fat cells produce toxic substances that cause damage to your body. You can work out if youre at increased risk by simply measuring your waist. Find the bottom of your ribs and the top of your hips, and measure around your middle at a point midway between these. For many people this will be at the level of the tummy button. Remember not to breathe in! Increased risk Severe risk Men white European Over 94cm 37 over 102cm 40 Men AfricanCaribbean, South Asian and some other minority ethnic groups over 90cm 35.5 Women white European Over 80cm 32 over 88cm 35 Women AfricanCaribbean, South Asian and some other minority ethnic groups over 80cm 32 08 09 Why are there different measurements for people of different ethnicities? Research shows that if youre South Asian, AfricanCaribbean, Black African, Chinese, Middle Eastern or have parents of two or more different ethnic groups, you may be at increased risk of some health conditions at a lower BMI than people from white European backgrounds. This means the measurements that indicate severe risk are lower for people from these groups.

Marchello lost 9st 7lbsSECTION 1 GET READY TO GO bEFORE YOU START Losing weight can be hard, and managing your weight will need to be a lifelong commitment. The habits that have led you to become overweight took time to develop, so changing to healthier habits will take time too. Before you start your weight loss journey, its important to make sure youre feeling positive and prepared for the challenge. Identifying things that did and didnt go well in the past can help you plan for the future. What factors do you think led you to gain weight? Was your weight gain linked to a particular time in your life for example, having children, stopping work, giving up smoking? What do you think has helped you to lose weight in the past?14 15 UNDERSTANDING WEIGHT GAIN To understand how weight gain and loss works, it can be helpful to think about your body as a balance of energy in and energy out. You take in energy through the calories in your food, and then you burn this energy off through your daily routine through things like walking, shopping and going to work. To stay the same weight, your energy in and energy out need to be the same. Weight gain happens when you take in more energy than you need. Energy in weight stays the same Energy out Energy in weight gain Energy out Energy in weight lossEnergy out So to lose weight, you need to tip the balance by taking in less energy and by burning more energy up. This means reducing your food intake and increasing your levels of physical activity. Food intake Physical activity Lose weight FACING THE CHALLENGES It can be easy to focus on the positive things that can come from losing weight such as buying new clothes, feeling great, and having more energy. But often there is a cost too to lose weight you might need to change things that you enjoy or have been doing for a long time, like eating less than others around you or changing your schedule to do more activity. Thinking about the advantages and disadvantages realistically will help you predict the things that might make your plans difficult to stick to. This way you can think ahead and find ways to overcome them.16 17 Think about the last time you were able to lose weight. What was different between then and now? For example, did you have someone to support you, were you more active, did you have less opportunity to snack between meals? If you lost weight, then put it back on, what do you think caused you to regain weight? How quickly did the weight come back on again? Why do you think you have found it difficult to stick to changes in your eating and activity patterns? What have you learned from previous weight loss attempts that can help you stick with eating or activity changes this time? The hardest thing was just trying to stay dedicated I knew that unless I kept going, I wasnt ever going to get there. I took it step by step. Marchello lost 9st 7lbsTake some time to think about and write down the advantages and disadvantages of making changes to your lifestyle. Making changes to my lifestyle Advantages Disadvantages e.g. better heart health, more energy for family lifee.g. hard work, miss out on meals out Not making any changes to my lifestyle Advantages Disadvantages e.g. eat what I like, dont have to plan e.g. putting health at risk, feel tired all the time How Ill overcome my challenges...Now think about what it would be like if you didnt change anything and stayed the same weight Hopefully the advantages of changing will outweigh the disadvantages, but think about what could help you overcome the challenges youll face and jot down your ideas below18 19 KEEP A FOOD DIARY Filling out a food diary can be an extremely useful tool to help you control your weight. The thought of writing down what you eat may seem daunting. However, while it may be unnerving to see everything youve eaten, facing up to reality means youve already won half the battle. Your food diary will help you identify what changes you need to make to your diet and will reveal patterns in your eating that you may not have noticed before. This can help you succeed in your weight loss plan for example if you can identify what times of day you are more likely to want something to eat, you can plan to have healthy snacks or meals on hand, or plan activities to help distract yourself from snacking on foods high in fat or sugar. To keep your food diary, use the table on the following page to write down everything you eat and drink throughout the day. Dont worry about what the results look like. Just be honest with yourself and you will be taking the first steps to losing weight for your health.

By making your goal measurable, youll be able to check whether youve been successful in making the change. Achievable Be realistic about the changes you plan to make.

You may get results fast, but they are often difficult to follow in the long term so you give up, regaining the weight as quickly as it came off. Many fad diets involve avoiding certain food groups and may not provide all the nutrients your body needs. While any weight loss will require a change to your eating habits, it shouldnt mean missing out on nutrients. Fad diets are diets that tend to promise a quick, easy fix with rapid weight loss suggest that certain foods burn fat promote the eating of just one or two foods have lots of rules about how to eat, such as the times of day you should eat sound too good to be true. THE PRINCIPLES OF SUCCESS To help you lose weight, you need to take in less energy, and burn more energy up. This means you need to eat fewer calories. However, cutting down the quantity of food you eat is a difficult change to make and doing it the wrong way for example by skipping meals can be bad for you. To make it easier for you to succeed in cutting down your calories and losing weight, there are three key areas youll need to work on getting a healthy balance of food cutting down on the quantity you eat keeping to a regular eating pattern. By keeping to these principles and following the weight loss plan, this should help you achieve a gradual weight loss of 12 pounds 0.51kg per week. There may be some weeks when you lose more weight than this and other weeks where your weight may stay the same or go up. There can be many reasons for this being unwell, a special occasion, water retention or being more active but by tracing everything you will be able to look back and see why this may have happened.28 29 Ive made changes at this time of my life and it feels great. Vivinne lost 2st THE EATWELL PLATE Use the eatwell plate to help you get the balance right. It shows how much of what you eat should come from each food group. Fruit and vegetablesBread, rice,potatoes, pasta and other starchy foods Meat, fish,eggs, beans and other nondairy sources of protein Public Health England in association with the Welsh Goverment, the Scottish Government and the Food Standards Agency in Northern Ireland Crown copyright 2013Milk and dairy foods Foods and drinkshigh in fat andor sugarGETTING A HEALTHY bALANCE OF FOOD Eating and drinking fewer calories doesnt mean that you have to count calories or even cut out food. Healthy eating for weight loss means eating the right balance of food, but also the right amount of food. The best way to understand it is to think of foods in food groups. We need more foods from some food groups and less from others but you dont need to give up any single food or drink completely. You should choose to eat mainly healthier foods that you enjoy, but it is fine to have a treat now and again. The eatwell plate opposite shows the types and proportion of foods you need to eat to achieve a wellbalanced and healthy diet. It covers everything you eat during the day including snacks. For a balanced diet you should try to eat plenty of fruit and vegetables plenty of bread, rice, potatoes, pasta and other starchy foods choose wholegrain varieties whenever you can some milk and dairy foods some meat, fish, eggs, beans and other nondairy sources of protein just a small amount of foods and drinks high in fat andor sugar. You dont always need to get the balance perfect at every meal, but try to get it right over a longer time such as a whole day or week and try to choose foods that are lower in fat, salt and sugar when you can. Eating with the proportions of the eatwell plate in mind will ensure you get the right balance of vitamins and minerals as well as starch and fibre, while keeping fat and sugar down. This will not only help you keep your weight down, but also reduce your risk of coronary heart disease, some cancers, and dental problems.30 31 CUTTING DOWN ON HOW MUCH YOU EAT Even if you think you are already eating very healthily, it may be that your portions are too large, which means you will be taking in more calories than you are using up, resulting in weight gain. This weight loss plan will help you manage the quantity, as well as the type of food that you eat Everyone is different, but to keep their weight the same most adult men need around 2,500 kilocalories kcal a day, and most adult women need around 2,000 kcal a day. National guidelines recommend that for sustainable weight loss, a reduction in calorie intake of about 500600 kcal a day should be combined with stepping up your physical activity levels. To lose weight, the average man can eat or drink 1,800 kcal a day. The average woman can eat or drink 1,500 kcal a day to lose weight. Your calorie intake includes all your food and drink and should be based on the food groups from the eatwell plate. This weight loss plan will help you achieve the right number of calories a day by eating a certain number of portions of different types of food. How many calories should I be eating? If you normally eat a lot more than the recommended amount of calories you may find it hard to cut back to our suggested calorie limit and number of portions straight away. You can use your food diary on page 22 to work out how many portions from each food group you are currently having. If youre eating many more than the recommended number of portions, aim to gradually reduce your portion sizes to those recommended in the plan, over a few weeks. If you have any questions about the number of portions or calories you should be eating, talk to a healthcare professional such as your GP , nurse or dietitian.32 33 What are kilocalories? A kilocalorie is another word for what is commonly called a calorie . So 1,000 calories will be written as 1,000kcals. CAN I INDULGE ? Nothing is banned, but foods from the foods and drinks high in fat and sugar group provide a lot of calories with little nutritional benefit, so you shouldnt eat too much of foods from this group. Think of these as foods to be enjoyed occasionally, rather than as everyday necessities. Although there is a limit to the amount of foods in this group you can have each day, you can save your allowance up over the week if youd prefer having none on one day and more on another. Many people find they eat differently at weekends or when eating out, so this way you can keep your indulgences up your sleeve for those times when you really need them!KNOW YOUR PORTIONS How much is a portion? With this weight loss plan, you wont have to count calories or weigh out your food. Instead, you just need to use the portion guides in section 3. This shows portions of common foods from all the food groups, so you can just choose as you wish. Portions are a funny thing. The normal helping of food you have in a meal may contain more than one portion. For example, a sandwich made up of two slices of bread would count towards 2 portions from the bread, rice, potatoes, and other starchy foods group and a bowl of rice may be 23 portions. Y oull find guidance on portions of lots of common foods in section 3 of the plan.34 35 HEALTHY bREAKFAST IDEAS INCLUDE wholegrain breakfast cereals like porridge with low fat milk or yoghurt toast with boiled, scrambled or poached eggs toast with baked beans, tinned tomatoes or grilled mushroom bowl of mixed fresh fruit with yoghurt you can have breakfast on the go too small boxes of wholegrain cereal, tubes of low fat yoghurt and fruit can fit in a bag or briefcase.KEEPING TO A REGULAR EATING PATTERN Eating regularly can help you achieve your weight loss goals because it helps to ensure you dont get too hungry, meaning youll be less likely to think about food between meals and less likely to turn to eating high calorie snacks. Once you get in the habit of eating at roughly the same times each day it will make it easier to control how much you eat. What is my current eating pattern? You can use your food diary to help identify what your eating patterns are like and ticking the boxes that apply to you below will also help If you are already eating regularly then move on to the next section. If you have ticked one or more of the boxes above, then you need to set some goals so that you can try and eat more regularly. Beginning the day with a healthy breakfast would be a good start. People who eat breakfast regularly on at least four or more days a week are more likely to stay a healthy weight than people who dont. It doesnt need to be a cooked breakfast a drink and a piece of fruit or a pot of yoghurt is a good start to get you into the habit.36 37 I skip breakfast more than once a week I have a large lunch and skip dinnerI regularly miss meals and snack throughout the day I have a late breakfast, skip lunch and have a large evening meal I dont eat all day and have a large evening meal 38 39 Ive lost just under a stone and 6cm from my waistline so far.

Andy lost 1st 7lbsA SIMPLE PLAN This table shows the daily portions of each food group you should aim to eat on the weight loss plan. By using this plan, youll be getting the right balance of food, and also the right amount of food, and calories, that will help you to lose weight. It really is as simple as that! Food group 1,500 kcal women1,800 kcal men Fruit and vegetables 5 or more portions 5 or more portions Bread, rice, potatoes, pasta and other starchy foods7 portions 8 portions Milk and dairy foods 3 portions 3 portions Meat fish, eggs, beans and other nondairy sources of protein2 portions 3 portions Spreading fats, oils, dressings sauces2 portions 3 portions Foods high in fat and sugar, alcoholUp to 100 kcal Up to 200 kcal40 41 FRUIT AND VEGETAbLES About a third of the food you eat should be made up of fruit and vegetables. You should aim to have at least 5 portions of fruit and veg every day. Research shows that people who eat more than 5 portions of fruit and vegetables a day have a lower risk of coronary heart disease. Fruit and vegetables contain vitamins and minerals which your body needs to keep healthy and they are naturally low in fat. They are also a good source of fibre, which makes them filling to eat, and they will keep your digestive system healthy. There are five ways to get your 5 a day the fruit or vegetables can be fresh frozen dried juiced or tinned make sure fruit is in water or natural juice, and vegetables are in water without sugar or salt added where possible. Ideas to help you get your 5 a day add fresh or dried fruit to your breakfast have fruit as a snack between meals have a bowl of salad with your meal if you have a ready meal, always add extra vegetables or salad to it add tinned beans such as red kidney beans and chickpeas to soups, stews, curry and pasta sauces use leftover vegetables to make soup.42 43 Eat 5 or more portions a day GETTING YOUR 5 A DAY Tips and tricks to help you overcome the common challenges of getting your 5 a day Fruit and vegetables are too expensive Try buying fresh fruit and veg when theyre in season theyre usually cheaper. Buy loose fruit and veg rather than prepacked so you just buy what you need. Opt for the supermarkets ownbrand tinned, dried and frozen fruit and vegetables including pulses and beans to keep costs down. Ive got no time to shop for fresh fruit and veg Stock up on tinned and frozen fruit and vegetables so you always have them ready to use. Dried fruit also keeps well and you can eat it as a snack or add to cereal and other recipes. My family dont like the taste of fruit and veg Set them the challenge of trying one new fruit or vegetable a week until you find some they enjoy. Sneak in added veg to family meals add grated carrot, chopped peppers or sweetcorn to your meals such as stirfrys, stews and even pizzas. Puree them for sauces or soups or mash into potatoes. Cutting fruit and vegetables into easytoeat chunks and sticks often makes them more appealing than a whole piece or try a fruit kebab for dessert.A FEW THINGS TO REMEMbER Potatoes, yams and plantain dont count towards your 5 a day they are starchy foods see page 50. Fruit juice and smoothies are nourishing but quite concentrated in calories. Keep to only one portion a small glass of unsweetened fruit juice or pure fruit smoothie a day. Avoid sugary squash or fruit juice drinks which have added sugar. Dried fruits are quite concentrated in natural sugar so have only one portion of these a day. Only one portion of pulses like kidney beans, chickpeas and baked beans can be counted as fruit and veg. Any more portions should be counted as a starchy food see page 51. The fruit and veg in sauces, soups, puddings and yoghurts can count towards your five a day but watch out for the salt and saturated fat in these foods. Avocado pears are high in healthy fats, but this means they are also high in calories.

No more than one a day Arent these foods fattening? Starchy foods sometimes called carbohydrates arent any more fattening than any of the other food groups. However it can be easy to eat more of these foods than we need, meaning the calories really add up! The key is to not add fat when youre cooking and preparing these foods, and keeping track of your portion sizes.48 49 bREAD , RICE, POTATOES, PASTA AND OTHER STARCHY FOODS About a third of your food should be starchy foods this food group is our bodys main source of energy and should be a part of all meals. Choose higher fibrewholegrain options when possible they contain more fibre, vitamins and minerals and provide energy that is released slowly, making you feel fuller for longer and less likely to snack between meals. These may seem like small portions but remember you can use more than one of your portions per meal see example meal plan on page 73. For things like cereal, rice and pasta it may be useful to weigh the portion out once to see what it looks like on the plate as a guide for the future. This can also help you prepare to judge your portions when youre eating out.

Protein is important for your body to work properly and these foods will provide you with vitamins, such as B12, and minerals including iron and zinc. As well as meat and fish, choose alternatives such as eggs, nuts and nut butter, pulses such as peas, beans and lentils and seeds, quorn and tofu.58 59 Eat 2 or 3 portions a day depending on your weight loss plan CHOOSING PROTEIN FOODS Some protein foods may also be high in fat, so choosing lower fat alternatives can make sure you are getting enough protein without that extra fat and calories. Choose lean cuts of meat. Remove visible fat and skin from meat and poultry. Limit how often you choose processed meats such as burgers, bacon, sausages, and pies they often contain a lot of hidden fat and salt. Choose fish, eggs, quorn , beans and lentils a few times a week.

Measure it out with a teaspoon rather than pouring it straight into the pan or use a spray oil. Make your own salad dressings using ingredients like balsamic vinegar, low fat yoghurt, lemon juice and herbs. FOODS AND DRINKS HIGH IN FAT AND SUGAR This group includes cakes, crisps, sweets, chocolate, sugary fizzy drinks and alcohol. These tend to be the foods we need to cut down on. While they can be included in a balanced diet, they are not essential. You should aim to have only small amounts of foods in this group swap these for healthier versions or keep them for special occasions only. If the foods you like arent on the list, use the calorie information, per serving size, from the nutritional information on the packets to work out how much of the food you can eat according to your weight loss plan. Use food labels to guide you to healthier versions of these foods or healthier alternatives look at page 79 for more info on food labels. You can have up to 100kcal to 200kcal a day depending on your weight loss plan. Remember if you like, you can spread this allowance out over the week, having none on one day and more on another.64 65 Tips for eating less fatty and sugary foods Choose diet, no added sugar or unsweetened versions of fizzy drinks, squashes and fruit juice Instead of snacks such as crisps, chocolate, pakora, samosas, sweet pastries and biscuits choose fruit, plain popcorn, wholegrain crackers or raw vegetables with a low fat dip like salsa or cucumber and yoghurt Use semi skimmed milk, 1 or skimmed milk rather than condensed milk or coconut milk.Mini pork pie One 196 kcalQuichetart One quarter of a small 60g 250 kcalChocolate bar One bar 45g 240 kcalDanish pastry Danish pastry 110g 376 kcal66 67 Ice cream One small scoop 100 kcalSpiritsABV 40 One measure or shot 25ml 56 kcalChocolate Three squares 78 kcalSugar One teaspoon 16 kcalJam One teaspoon 25 kcal Biscuits, plain Two 100 kcalSweets One small tube or bag 90 kcalGlass of wine ABV 12 One small glass 125ml 100 kcal Crisps One small packet 25g 150 kcalLager, cider or beer ABV 5 Half pint 117 kcalBottle of beer ABV 5 One 330ml bottle 135 kcalFOODS AND DRINKS HIGH IN FAT AND SUGAR Y ou can have up to 100 kcal to 200 kcal a day depending on your weight loss plan. Slice of cake One small slice 50g 150 kcal KNOW YOUR UNITS A unit is a measure of alcohol. The number of units is based on the size of the drink and its alcohol strength. The ABV alcohol by volume figure is the percentage of alcohol in the drink. Different strengths of drinks can contain different amounts of alcohol. Keep an eye on your glass size! Its easier than you think for the units to add up when youre drinking wine or pouring your own drinks. Note that wine is only 100ml for a unit, but normal sizes for glasses of wine in the pub are either 175ml small or 250ml large so that means a glass will be more than one unit.Men ...should not regularly drink more than 3 to 4 units of alcohol in a day. Thats not much more than a pint of strong lager, beer or cider. Women ...should not regularly drink more than 2 to 3 units of alcohol in a day.

Most people enjoy a drink or two and theres no reason why you shouldnt have an occasional drink when youre trying to lose weight. But alcohol is high in sugar, so its high in calories too drinks can really add up and affect your weight loss. Also, because alcohol is an appetite stimulant, some people notice they tend to eat more when they drink alcohol. Drinking too much alcohol can also be harmful to your health. It can lead to muscle damage, high blood pressure, stroke and some cancers. So if you drink alcohol, its important to keep within the sensible limits, however often you drink.This table shows you the amount of calories in some common drinks Drink Units Calories kcal Same as... 25ml single spirit ABV 401 Unit 56 3 fancy filled individual chocolates 66 kcal 50ml of cream liqueur ABV 171 Unit 118 Slice of Battenberg cake 119 kcal 275ml bottle of alcopop ABV 5.51.5 Units 170 2 chocolate covered biscuits 178 kcal 330ml bottle of strong lager, beer or cider ABV 51.6 Units 135 25g pack of salted crisps 132 kcal 440ml can of regular lager, beer or cider ABV 4.52.6 Units 182 Slice of sponge cake with cream and jam 182 kcal Standard glass 175ml of red, white or rosé wine ABV 132.3 Units 166 37g tube of chocolate covered sweets 169 kcal Standard glass 125ml champagne ABV 121 Unit 86 9 sweets 90 kcal Pint of strong lager, beer or cider ABV 52.8 Units 233 Sugar doughnut 242 kcal Large glass 250ml of red, white or rosé wine ABV 133.3 Units 195 Mini pork pie 196 kcal Pint of extra strong lager, beer or cider ABV 84.5 Units 358 Medium takeaway chicken curry 377 kcal Bottle 750ml of red, white or rosé wine ABV 13.510 Units 712 2 shish kebabs 714 kcal My top tip is to drink plenty of water. Its the best drink you can have when youre losing weight because its got no sugars in it, and no calories. Rif lost 13lbsTHINK AbOUT DRINKS Drinking enough is an important part of keeping healthy so you need to have regular nonalcoholic drinks around 6 to 8 drinks a day. The amount of drink you need does vary though for example if you do more activity than usual or if its a hot day you will need to drink more. You will get some water from the food you eat, but you still need to drink too. Many people dont realise how many calories they take in through their drinks, so when looking over your food diary think about what you drink and what swaps you can make. Cold drinks Water is the best choice, but you can include other nonalcoholic drinks during the day such as sugarfree squash or fruit juice. Avoid fizzy drinks that contain a lot of sugar and calories so choose sugarfree or diet alternatives instead. Flavoured waters with a hint of fruit are also good for mixing it up, but check they dont have any added sugar. Hot drinks You can include some tea and coffee among your daily drinks, but its important that this isnt your only source of fluid. This is because they make it harder for your body to absorb the iron you need from the food you eat and also contain caffeine, which is a stimulant. If you add sugar to your tea and coffee, try gradually reducing the amount you have by half a teaspoon so you get used to the taste before cutting it out completely. Remember to also think about the amount of milk in hot drinks as this can add calories at home or in the coffee shop go for the skinny option using skimmed milk and skip the cream on hot chocolate. Alcoholic drinks Alcoholic drinks should be counted as part of the foods high in fat andor sugar group.

Dont add salt to your food at the table your taste buds will soon adapt to the taste. Experiment with herbs and spices to add extra flavour. Choose foods labelled low salt or no added salt . Swap salty snacks such as crisps and salted nuts for fruit and vegetables. Avoid saltier foods such as bacon, cheese, takeaways, ready meals and other processed food. Saturated fats These can raise the amount of cholesterol in your blood, especially the harmful LDL cholesterol which increases the risk of fatty deposits developing in your arteries. Top tips to cut the amount of fat you eat Cut down on high fat snacks like crisps, chocolates, biscuits, samosas and pakoras. Change to low fat dairy products use semiskimmed or skimmed milk and choose low fat yoghurts and cheese. Buy the leanest cuts of meat you can and avoid processed meat products like sausages and bacon. Remove the skin and visible fat from meat before cooking. Try baking, boiling, steaming, poaching or microwaving your food instead of frying, so that you dont need to add fat. Buy a nonstick frying pan and roasting tray so you can cook without adding fat. Measure out oil with a teaspoon or use spray oil rather than pouring it straight from the bottle. Spoon off fats and oils from casseroles and curries.CUTTING DOWN ON SALT AND SATURATED FAT To keep your heart healthy its important that you dont eat too much salt or saturated fat. Eating too much salt can increase your risk of high blood pressure, and this increases your chance of developing coronary heart disease. The recommended maximum amount of salt for adults is 6g a day which is about a level teaspoon. Most people dont realise how much salt theyre having and go over this limit Remember that all types of salt count including sea salt, flakes, crystals and garlic salt and its not just about the salt that you add to food yourself. Most of the salt we eat is hidden in foods. Foods high in salt include soups, sauces, cheese, savoury snacks, biscuits, pizza, ready meals and fast foods. There can also be a lot of salt in everyday foods like bread and breakfast cereals.76 77 I think you should be able to give yourself treats.

Choose a scone or currant bun instead of a pastry, cream cake or chocolate muffin. If sandwiches are being made deli style, say no to extra cheese, mayo and sauces. Plan what youre going to eat before you go some companies have online menus you can use to choose the healthier options. Portion sizes are often bigger when youre eating out so dont feel you have to finish whats on your plate. Share a starter or pudding rather than having your own. Ask for dressings and sauces on the side so you can decide how much to add and remember the extras you add like cheese, sour cream and dressings can be high in fat and salt. Go for tomato or vegetablebased sauces and soups rather than cream, coconut or cheesebased ones. Choose plain boiled rice instead of fried and go for boiled or jacket potatoes rather than chips or wedges. Choose steamed or stirfried options rather than deepfried dishes batter is off the menu!EATING OUT Eating out usually means we have little control over how food is prepared or how large the portion is. The food also tends to be high in fat, salt and sugar and the healthy choices are not that obvious. But there are some things you can do to reduce the impact on your weight loss goals, meaning having the odd meal out is unlikely to make a difference to your weight in the long run.80 81 82 83 The hardest part about losing weight is the time it takes its not overnight.

Overcome obstacles with forward planning Think how you will deal with challenging situations before they arise. For instance, if you are eating out you can check the menus beforehand to find a healthy option. Identify changes Look over your goals and pick out what you need to do to achieve them or who might be able to help. For example, talking to your family, clearing out your cupboards, looking up some recipes or asking a friend at work to join you in lunchtime walks. Dont let one slip ruin your hard work a lapse is not a collapse. If you break your plan for a few hours or days, it is not the end of the world. Try not to see your goals as all or nothing . Learn from what went wrong and get back on track as soon as you are ready. Make sure you plan something healthy to reward yourself when you reach your goals see page 89 this will keep you going if it does get tough.84 85 CHANGE YOUR bEHAVIOUR As you know, changing your diet needs a lot of careful thought and effort. Often we know what we should be doing, but somehow find it difficult to stick to changes. Thats not to say its always an uphill battle, but there are some things you can do to make it a bit easier for yourself. Many of these things involve a little planning ahead or thinking about things differently. They all help you feel more in control of what you are trying to achieve. For a lot of people these behaviour changes are the key to successful and permanent weight loss. The list below shows some simple actions which people have found helpful eating at the same time every day eating sitting down at the table do nothing else while eating dont waste the calories taste and enjoy them! pause during meals and put your knife and fork down between mouthfuls shopping on a full stomach writing a shopping list and stick to it keeping healthy snacks easily to hand e.g. fresh fruit in a bowl, chopped salad or vegetables in the fridge cleaning your teeth after a meal or when you get the urge to overeat serving your meal straight onto a plate and remove serving dishes from the table so youre less tempted to eat too much practicing refusing offers to overeat learn to say no thank you politely but firmly.86 87 REWARD YOURSELF Rewards can make it more likely you will achieve your goals. They should not be food or drink and need not be expensive. Here are some suggestions that have worked for others time to yourself such as a soak in the bath or sitting in the garden buy yourself a new magazine, item of make up, new DVD or video game take a trip to a cinema, theatre or art gallery have a manicure, pedicure or massage donate to your favourite charity.88 89 KNOW YOUR DANGER POINTS As well as things you can do differently, there are also ways you can teach yourself to think differently. Along with your food diary, using the suggestions below can help you get your mind over matter and feel more in control of your weight loss. Real hunger or cravings A regular eating pattern is the best way to keep hunger at bay, but often you can experience a strong urge to eat, usually for a specific type of food such as a pudding after a very filling evening meal. Before you eat, check that you are really hungry rather than just eating at a certain time or occasion out of habit. Try waiting 20 minutes, if you arent actually hungry these feelings will pass. Using distractions will also help you control your eating make a phone call, do the washing up or clean your teeth. Feelings or triggers Be aware of how your feelings affect what you want to eat. For example do you eat more when you are bored, lonely or upset? Noticing a pattern can help you plan how to cope. Identifying activities apart from food that you find comforting is one way round this problem. You could treat yourself to a new magazine or listen to your favourite music instead. EMMA S STORY I knew I was really overweight, but I didnt want to acknowledge it, so I just sort of forgot about it. But I got to a place where I knew if I got any bigger I would never be happy unless I started losing weight. My friend is a personal trainer and she offered to help me, but because of an existing illness she said I needed go to the doctor to get checked out before we started. I went and they gave me the BHF weight loss plan to do alongside the exercise. I went home and read the plan and said right this is it its now or never . So although Id put on the weight gradually the decision to start losing weight was an overnight thing everything had clicked into place. The hardest part about losing weight is the time it takes its not overnight. Ive lost nearly 9 stone now and sometimes it was hard to keep it going. But theres no way of getting round it no weight loss is easy. And I know that Im always going to have to watch what I eat. Starting cycling really helped me. I set myself the goal of completing the BHF London to Brighton bike ride. My first 6 miles of training were awful I hated every minute of it, puffing and panting. But after a while I started to really enjoy it. Now I can cycle 75 miles plus with no problem, its become a social thing and my boyfriend and I go out for a ride as much as we can. We get to spend time together and its so much better for me than sitting in a pub or on the sofa thinking about what I can eat. My advice to others is to be your own inspiration focus on yourself, make small goals, take realistic baby steps if you dont you will go stir crazy. Embrace everything and then celebrate when you can. Even now I sometimes have to look in the mirror and tell myself that Ive worked really hard to get where I am. And Ive had great support without it I would not be where I am now. Its the small things like being comfortable wearing a dress that have made all the difference. And now I can do things Id missed out on in the past like ride my horses, and I definitely wouldnt have found cycling if I hadnt lost the weight. Emma lost 9st90 91 HOW MUCH SHOULD YOU AIM TO DO? For weight loss and heart health, you should aim to exercise daily and in total should be clocking up at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity activity every week thats activity which involves moving different parts of your body, getting slightly breathless but still able to talk and becoming a little hot and sweaty. This doesnt have to mean going to classes or taking up jogging. Its more about finding something which suits you and which is safe and enjoyable. Aim to increase your activity levels gradually. Start by aiming for up to half an hour a day of moderate activity on at least five days of the week. Then build this up gradually to help with your weight loss. What activity should you do? You can build activity into your everyday life with a bit of thought and determination. Walking is particularly good because it doesnt cost anything and you dont need a membership or any special kit other than sensible shoes! People have found that taking the stairs instead of the lift up as well as down, walking to the shops, cycling to work, digging the garden or playing outdoors with the children can make quite a difference. If more structured exercise appeals to you such as swimming, the gym or exercise classes find out if your local leisure centre runs sessions at a time which suits you. Our Get active, stay active booklet has information, tips and support to help you set some goals and build activity into your day download or order for free at bhf.org.ukpublications. If you have any health problems, check with your doctor before starting a physical activity programme. We also have an online physical activity calculator which is easy to use and a great way to see how all activity counts towards your weight loss from daily chores to more intense activity like running or cycling. The table shows some examples, but go to bhf.org.ukcalories to get the results tailored to you.GET MOVING This guide has mainly focused on how to reduce your calorie intake to help you lose weight, but you will know from page 14 that you can also lose weight by increasing the amount of calories you burn being active. Increasing your daily activity helps burn calories that would otherwise end up stored as fat. It also builds muscle. The more muscle you have the more energy your body uses when resting and the easier it is to lose weight. Regular activity is a vital part of your weight loss journey its essential to maintain a healthy weight in the long term. Physical activity also improves your heart health and reduces the risk of developing heart disease, diabetes and some cancers. This is true no matter what weight you are or how much weight you lose as a result of being active.

To sustain it you need to be able to give yourself little rewards from time to time. Andy lost 1st 7 lbs TRACK YOUR PROGRESS Its really important to track your progress so you can see how you are doing and check your progress against the S.M.A.R.T. goals you have set yourself. The chart on page 100 will help you to record everything. Monitoring your weight We recommend you keep a regular record of your weight. But dont be tempted to weigh yourself more than once a week. Weigh yourself on the same scales and at the same time of day, without clothes if possible. Remember you are looking for a gradual weight loss of 12 pounds 0.51 kg per week. There may be some weeks when you lose more weight than this and other weeks where your weight may stay the same or go up. There can be many reasons for this being unwell, a special occasion, water retention or being more active but by tracing everything you will be able to look back and see why this may have happened. Rewards Make sure you plan your nonfoodbased rewards see page 89 to keep you going when it gets tough, and to give yourself a pat on the back when you get there. You can use them for reaching behaviour goals as well as weight goals. Make sure you think about how you are going to reward yourself before you start your weight loss plan, as this will motivate you.96 97 98 99 RIFS STORY My friends were the ones who encouraged me to lose weight. Theyd taken part in a weight loss programme and I saw their results. One went seriously into it, and now he looks younger and slimmer. If he can do it I can do it as well. Ive started exercising twice a week. The main thing Ive learnt is that youve got to keep going at it. In the past I would always say Im busy, I havent got time . I was always making excuses but you can make time, youve got to put the effort in. Youve just got to push yourself basically. Ive changed the way Im eating. The hardest part was giving up the bad foods, you know your children tend to like those kind of foods and its temptation! But my advice would be to plan your way in Ive found preparing food that was a lot healthier does take more time, but if you have a menu ready for the week it makes life a lot easier, so you go home, you know what youre preparing, youve got the stuff there and ready for you. Ive lost just under a stone and 6cm from my waistline. It was quite hard going Ive still got quite a way to go but its quite a loss for me. Now Im fitting into trousers that I havent worn for years I feel good that Im back into some of my old jeans, and when a lot of friends come up to you it boosts your confidence even more all those things have definitely encouraged me. So I would say just dont give up, keep trying. If you keep going youll eventually succeed. A lot of people say I cant do it but theres no way you can if you dont try.

By reassessing things, making a few small changes, and getting support, you will start to lose a few pounds again.1 0 2 1 0 3 PAMS STORY I was about 15 years old when someone gave me a diet book. At the time I didnt realise anyone thought of me as overweight, and when I look back at pictures I wasnt! But I started being conscious of what I ate. From then on I yoyo dieted, but a couple of years ago I made a lasting change I lost three stone and Ive kept it off. One of the key things was recognising how I feel and how that affects how I eat. Thinking what do you really need? Do you need a box of chocolates, or do you need to cry, or do you need a hug? For exercise what Ive tried to do is find things that I really enjoy, the stuff that Id do even if there wasnt anyone cracking the whip. I think you need to make sure youre going to the gym because you want to feel good and you want to live longer and be healthier focus on the real benefit for you. Thats the key thing. One of the biggest challenges is other peoples expectations oh go on, treat yourself, live a little! its important to find ways to feel strong in yourself, to not give in just because its what somebody else wants for you when it isnt what you want for you. Concentrate on doing it because youre the one who wants to do it and this is good for you. I know Im always going to have to have my eye on the ball. It can sound a bit pessimistic but realistically I cant ever just say Im not going to think about how I feel or what Im eating and now that Im thinner I can just live my life . Thats what Ive done before and Ive just put the weight back on. But there are definitely things about the way I eat and the way that I feel and the way I react to things that I have changed for good. Im not forcing myself, it just thats the way I do it now. Its about making habits that stick.
